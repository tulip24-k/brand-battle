Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n\",3\\n\"This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying\\xe2\\x80\\x8b this unreliable product.Thanks.\\n\",1\\n\"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\\n\",4\\n\"Its sound quality is adorable. overall it was good but just for 2 weeks after that it stopped working and since then it never powered on again. I am claiming for warrenty and it is still undergoing.\\n\",1\\n\"Its Awesome... Good sound quality & 8-9 hrs battery life... Just waww look... \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 I brought just 999 rupees...But Amazon\\'s Packageing system is Very bad... Very poor packaging... Flipcart\\'s packaging system is much better than Amazon...\\n\",5\\n\"After 11 days, the charging port isn\\'t working and now I can\\'t even return it. Wat to do ?? I know there is one year warranty but it is only been 11 days. C\\'mon boat, please send me new one.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound-4.5/5Build quality-4.5/5Battery life -4/5Earphones quality is good with strong magnetic lock... Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good... Buttons quality is good.. sound is full of punchy bass and and balanced treble and has sorrund effect.. good fitting in ears.. hope connectivity is good.. bcz my last boat Bluetooth bassheads 225 had connection issues... This is worth its price... Hope the packaging was good ...there was no bubble wrapping..\\n\",4\\n\"After one month usage reviewing this .Pros-1- sound quality2- design3- weight4- batteryCons1- very bad mic for talking2- can\\'t use while riding bike3 - Music is too loud\\n\",3\\n\"I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.\\n\",5\\n\"The product durability is 1 month..I just lost my bill details so i cant claim my warrenty .. But this earphones built quality is bad . It stops wrking completely after 1 month sep 14 to nov 11 \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x88 life span .. Dont lose ur bill details incase u want that warranty..  And after purchasing u must register ur product in boat\\'s site for replacement and warranty\\n\",1\\n\"The sound quality is good. I mean it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be compared with Senheiser or Bose but its worth the price.Perfect to use while running; the earbuds are so comfortable that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even feel they are plugged in.\\n\",4\\n\"What on earth is the use of buying such product when it stop working in one month....your happiness sailed off like a BoAt.... #Disappointed\\n\",1\\n\"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I\\'m obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\\n\",5\\n\"Product stopped working in a month time\\n\",1\\n\"Right speaker is not working at all. Useless product.Big disappointment.\\n\",1\\n\"Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that\\'s fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn\\'t get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\\n\",3\\n\"This sound and bass quality is good battery life good noise cancelling is good but its wire is too long and uncomfortable which is not looking good wire is starting from top its looking bad but anyway everything is ok\\n\",4\\n\"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted.\\n\",3\\n\"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible\\n\",1\\n\"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don\\'t think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\\n\",3\\n\"The product is great intially !But the real test is after 2 months of useSo reviewing the product after two months of usePros1 The earphones drives you a very rich sound quality inspite of being wireless2 The neck band makes it much more durable then the other earphones3 The flat wire is very durable and the magnets saves it from you loosing it4 The 45 degree tilted earbuds just fits right in most of the ears (you can check with other 45 degree tilted earphones for a day that weather you are comfortable with it or not )5 It comes with 2 pairs of extra buds the small and big while the medium one is already on itCons1 - The connectivity of dual phones is not that easy as shown.(>Connect the earphone to phone A as usual>Disconnect it from the phone A by switching off the Bluetooth on phone A>Now connect the earphone to phone B>Switch off the earphone and switch it on back>Open the Bluetooth settings on phone A and B>From the paired device list select boAt rockers 255 on both the device at the same time.On the earphones you will get to hear YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED TO BOAT ROCKERZ 255 TWICE )2- You get a cracking sound when ideal or just before you dial a number on dial pad3 - Battery life is not accurateSometimes it work hours with 40-60 % battery while sometime it is dead on 80%So Dont rely on the battery indicator  at all but the battery once charged for 2-3 hours works constantly for 5-6 hours on normal volume.I hope this was of some help do mark it helpful  if so...Overall you should go for it when you get a exciting deal on this product\\n\",4\\n\"Don\\'t you guys check the product before selling ? just received the product and one side of the earphone is working and the other is not !\\n\",5\\n\"Got it today, really loved the product.. awesome sound.. i was thinking to buy the Airpod but a friend suggested this to me.. Why spend so much!! So i ordered this and this really is amazing.. it looks good.. have great sound and doesnt hurt ua ears!! I am totally satisfied with this and couldnt say about battery as i have got it, today itself!\\n\",5\\n\"Rightside speaker stop working within 20 days.\\n\",1\\n\"Overall good!But I am unable to connect two devices simultaneously. Please Guide how can i do that.Thank you!\\n\",4\\n\"I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it\\'s really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it\\'s 6hrs but it\\'s more than that, for me it\\'s working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"Defective product. Not working, had to return the defective product.\\n\",1\\n\"Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn\\'t work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was \"\" Appario Retail Private Ltd\"\". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform.\\n\",1\\n\"I am a prime customer of Amazon and I always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me I am blown away by these I have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range \"\"sound quality\"\" 10/10 \"\"battery life\"\" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon \"\"durability\"\" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... Really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... Just go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"Battery is faulty\\n\",1\\n\"Boat blue tooth 255, ye doubt Voice quality is amazing for 30 days or so you will be big FAN or Boat but after 30days.. voice from of the side going down and even after 35 days you will not be able to hear anything from one sideBoat Service on same again so pathetic , raise an complaint almost 10days back  for replacement or rapair but after 10days its reaches to their rapir center, not sure how many more days Boat will take to repair... Big Suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS\\n\",2\\n\"Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.\\n\",5\\n\"Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The sound is nothing great, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bit on the bassy side. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Connectivity is quick and painless \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in my jeans.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Battery life is nothing to write home about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I listen to music constantly even when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got great build quality for the price \\xe2\\x80\\x93 looks and feels premium. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tangle at all.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!\\n\",1\\n\"The headphones were good at the beginning but after a week getting disturbance on left side earpiece which stays for sometime\\n\",1\\n\"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It\\'s durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.\\n\",4\\n\"Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.\\n\",5\\n\"The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.\\n\",1\\n\"Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.\\n\",2\\n\"The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing \\'Oops! Battery low!\\' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.\\n\",3\\n\"Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.\\n\",5\\n\"I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon\\'s insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating \"\"You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255\"\"2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it\\'s my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it\\'s a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is good. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. battery quality is decent. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue\\n\",4\\n\"Awesome best budget wireless earphones\\n\",5\\n\"Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn\\'t liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.\\n\",5\\n\"Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can\\'t take it off the whole day.Don\\'t expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.\\n\",3\\n\"** the product was a perfect purchase... but it is not charging, requested for replacement..Replacement is quick and so prominent... Thank You boAt team...Pros:\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Soft feeling wearing this \"\"boAT Rockerze\"\" and look also good..\\xe2\\x80\\xa2The sound quality is excellent, it\\'s like a premium brands...\\xe2\\x80\\xa2I am using just after receiving the product without charging and it is going on and on. The battery lasts for full 2days. Am so happy.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Value for money.Cons:-Not find still now...\\n\",5\\n\"Pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).Lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc.\\n\",4\\n\"I got it for INR999 and that\\'s the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you\\'ll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it\\'s a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it\\'s still running very strong though i don\\'t use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it\\'s earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don\\'t bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There\\'s no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for \"\" Audiophiles\"\" ,well if you are one , you won\\'t be looking at these anyway. So that\\'s it . Happy shopping.\\n\",4\\n\"Worst product\\n\",1\\n\"Nice product. I love it\\'s sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it\\'s sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it\\'s power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let\\'s see how many days it will again goes.\\n\",4\\n\"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn\\'t be this long.Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.\\n\",4\\n\"Totally disappointed with the product and returned it. Boat rockerz 225 is better than this.\\n\",1\\n\"I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:Pros:1. Good Bass2. Sturdy3. Great look4. Good noise cancellationCons:1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.\\n\",1\\n\"Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It\\'s good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I\\'m using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is  quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.The only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. However my OnePlus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. The headphone give the annoying message \"\"battery is low\"\" from 20% onwards.\\n\",5\\n\"I had brought the piece after reading lot of reviews etc. when i purchased and started using it turned off and said battery low .. Thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..It started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . I checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .Tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range.\\n\",1\\n\"Very bad it\\'s been only 3 months and it\\'s one earphone is not working . One year warranty is useless no service centre service is there for help only waste of money .\\n\",1\\n\"This Bluetooth  earphone  is just a beast  ! It has amazing  bass ! Sound quality  is just mind blowing  ! This product  is value for money  ! Suggeste you to buy these if you are looking  for amazing  earphones  under rs 2500 . These earphones  have a very good range and provide  a usage time of  7 hrs on a charge of 45 to 60 mins .\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is worst\\n\",1\\n\"Got the delivery today(12/12/2018)Initial Impressions:The Audio was really good..nice bass..comfortable fit.Audio 4/5But after few hours of usage the right earphone stopped working..Audio output through right earphone is not as loud as left earphone.\\n\",1\\n\"Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn\\'t look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express\\n\",3\\n\"Good Bluetooth in the ear headphones....Sound quality is decent....may seem a little thin, takes time to get used to, but definitely not bad or poor.Battery life too is decent( around 5-6 hrs) when connected.Build quality is good, though you need to b a little careful.All in all a VALUE FOR MONEY deal ( especially sweet since I got it at an attractive deal price of INR 999 during the Great Indian Amazon Sale).\\n\",4\\n\"Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can\\'t disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup \\'WAS\\' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That\\'s why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH\\n\",1\\n\"Product not working within 1 month from purchase\\n\",1\\n\"It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn\\'t worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market\\n\",3\\n\"Just got this and I must say that the build quality is great. Coming to the sound it has really good bass. Can\\'t comment of the battery yet as I just got it. I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.\\n\",5\\n\"The headphones are good, however the first one broke within one month, and boat replaced it, so kudos. Battery life is enough for one and half of my gym sessions, so I\\'d say between 5-6 hrs. Sound is clear with good depth.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.\\n\",4\\n\"In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.\\n\",4\\n\"It is too bad..this ear phones could not completed even a month it has been only 20 days..and it\\'s battery getting heated battery running time getting shorter by the time today it play only 1 hour ,next thing is it has been 5 days since it\\'s one side earhone is not working..feeling cheated..\\n\",1\\n\"The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I\\'ll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I\\'ll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That\\'s all for now amigos.\\n\",5\\n\"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn\\'t recommend for serious workouts.\\n\",2\\n\"Better in price range of 1399 best for use microphone quality is like wired headphone not only good for hearing music but also for talking with ur love ones at night.. best in all ur budget is under 1500 if ur budget is 4000 then go true wireless but in that u will miss the microphone quality u have to speak louder good for daily use bass is not best but okay type in this price range of wireless headphone neon and black colour is good all the three colours look awesome noise cancellation is not that much it fit properly u can use for gym heavy workout but due to neckband its little heavier and feeling of wired around neck as this is Bluetooth headset then not that much long lasting coz u have to charge the battery and one day after one year may the battery get damaged don\\'t charge is frequently once its less than 20% than only charge this headphone battery backup of continues use in starting is 4 to 5hrs and at standby mode u can use it for 2days.. once u get this u will forget ur phone as whenever call will come u Don\\'t have to run just use ur connected headset to receive the call . U can also pair smart watch and this headset together\\n\",5\\n\"I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can\\'t hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!\\n\",3\\n\"# Light but well built, doesn\\'t feel bulky# Battery lasts 6-7 hours, could have been little longer, but its fine# Volume and power buttons are of good quality# Excellent noise cancellation# Sound quality is something I didn\\'t expect of this level - Good, very good. Good punch, high frequencies are delivered well, deep and rich bass. Loved it!!# Bluetooth works flawlessly\\n\",5\\n\"Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won\\'t get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries...\\n\",4\\n\"Bought this 4 months back.Pros- good sound, nice battery back, very light on neck.  Good only for listening to musicCons - really bad for using it for its actual purpose. It has got no noise cancellation hence people will nt be able to hear you clearly.My advice avoid buying it as you can\\'t return it\\n\",2\\n\"Pathetic quality\\n\",1\\n\"Its not sweat proof that is clear it will malfunction when you run on treadmill wearing itSound is goodBattery is goodbut its not full sweatproofAlso will stop working after one month\\n\",1\\n\"Can\\'t compare with sony or any other branded ones. But in this price it\\'s good. Silicon material good to wear no feeling of like we are carrying it on our neck . Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material.  As this is in ear canal type speakers we. Eed to really push it inside the canal 1st 1/3.then only we can enjoy real beats and bass. If you wear it superficially sound won\\'t look great. So far battery , durability,sound ,price this is best one.\\n\",4\\n\"I buyed the product and it stopped working after 2 months.The after sale service of boat is very bad and pathetic .\\n\",1\\n\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell by touch if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t initiate pairing(I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.\\n\",1\\n\"The sound output is great. The built quality 8s also looks good. The battery backup is absolutely phenomenal. The brand is also very reliable. They will provide free pickup if you will face any problem within the warranty period. I got this product at 999/- only \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8c\\n\",5\\n\"Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won\\'t hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you\\'re plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that\\'s a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.\\n\",4\\n\"I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying \"\"your battery is low\"\" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won\\'t recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!\\n\",2\\n\"CONS:-These earphones does not tell remaining battery till it is very low. A button should be there to know battery life.-After battery gets low they don\\'t last more then 6 mins or so. Also voice assistant keeps shouting battery low. They become unusable.-More earbuds should be there. 3 sizes do not fit all.PROS:- Boat has best after sales support no other company comes close to them. Repair and replacements are completely hassle free. \"\"THIS IS WHY I PURCHASED THESE\"\".-Sound quality is good.-Build quality is good.-Water resistant-Battery lasts sufficiently long .\\n\",3\\n\"I don\\'t usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don\\'t use it for like 3-4 hours. It\\'s very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don\\'t know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don\\'t know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it\\'s really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says \"\"Oops, battery low\"\". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it\\'s not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn\\'t last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.\\n\",2\\n\"Pros :1)Product quality good,sound good .2)light weight3)battery time /playback time over all good4)connectivity averageCons:1)After 30 min yr ears feeling presure2)Good connectivy when phone is in range3)some times i feel the lil slage in connectivity while silenting music.4) Its Not a product for daily bike commuters due to low noice cancellation.Overall good product on bases of prices...\\n\",3\\n\"Honestly First bummer was packaging.It looks like it was already opened.The package got little torn.. tape looks off the place. Also, earphones inside also didn\\'t looked like fresh packaging. It really looks like It was used before.but I could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. Range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. You will always feel some disturbance while playing.Also, I tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it\\'s connected to other device. First, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected.\\n\",4\\n\"after 3 days of use I am writing this review.. I have got it at Rs. 999.001) battery life almost 5 hours of music.  not a problem for me.2) built up quality good.3) most importantly sound quality not awesome. may be good. if u like bass a great then good choice but vocal sound is seemed lower and sometimes not crystal clear. I have senheiser cx180 which costs rs.750. produces much crisp sound and bass.but overall at rs. 999 it is a good deal.\\n\",4\\n\"Hello I bought this product in big sale going on , got it for 1099 which is good deal.Later on it was for 2.5k don\\'t buy at this price waste of money.Sound n bass is awesomeBattery not sure yetSongs can\\'t be changed using music keys and music key functions are uncertainMusic starts playing from phone suddenly after the callDouble tapping of play/stop button dials last caller, which is greatest con of this product\\n\",2\\n\"I have already used boat earphone and was quite satisfied with the performance interms of sound and bass, however I didn\\'t expect that much this boat rockers 255 is tremendously performing great sound, clearance, noice cancellation bass will never gonna feel you headache and all if I talk about battery it works 7 Hours a day continuesly...well fitted in ear without any pain got this deal at lightning price at 999.Thanks Amazon to provide such deal and swift delivery and your faith!!!\\n\",4\\n\"Good for a few weeks. After that the battery heated up drastically, and melted the rubber buttons. I luckily stopped charging in time, else may have even caught fire. Now the buttons are fused and the product can\\'t be used.Hope Amazon will promptly replace the defective product.\\n\",1\\n\"Amazon packaging : Not up to the mark, only comes in a plastic ploybag which is the outer bag, no internal protection per se!Durability : looks sturdy, package also says sweat resistant, only delicate part is the charging port flap :PSound : it rockss!! Bass as well as treblesOne good thing is it wont let you increase the sound beyond a threshold via headphones ( u can do it from phone :P)Noice cancellation is awesome.Felt slightly more protruding, needs to be inserted deep into ear\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x82 otherwise chances of falling down ( not on the ground btw)Package contains : charging cable 10-15 cm long, 2 pairs of buds of different sizes, warranty card + manualColour : red + black matt finish.Its post delivery feedback so no idea of battery backup, charging, sweat proof. (Will add later)\\n\",4\\n\"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been lately using a lot of products from boat !This product was on offer so thought of ordering the same.I was using base heads 225 beforeWhen compared directly to them this earphone is not that great in terms of base but !!!! The earphone is wireless which takes away all the things !It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quiet light weight ! And the price is just awesome for the same. The earphone is very easy to connect and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quiet reliable too! One can wear whole day and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even feel them. The sound quality is more over on the base side. If you are someone who love good base then this is for you !Do give it a try and this product won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disappoint you !The service of boat is way ahead then other brands\\n\",5\\n\"Writing this review after using boAt 225 wireless headset and JBK t160BT...I must say that boAt has got excellent bass and sound quality compared to JBL one.Superb sound quality and built. Very comfortable in ears. Value for Money!!!\\n\",5\\n\"Dear All,Let me write the genuine review of this product.The product was delivered on time,Guys, I am using this product since 2 last month and I have discovered an excellent product.The product is much better as compare to other costly international brands.Likes :* Excellent bass* Noise cancellation support* Value for moneyDislikes:* I expect more form the local brand in terms of quality of material used e.g. plastic quality and packaging box.Overall suggestion you buy with this price..!\\n\",4\\n\"I can\\'t get enough of this earphones.. Sound qulity is so clear in highs and lows.. Battery life is more than expected from a bluetooth earphone.. It is showing more than 1 day battery life. And the quality of the material used is so nice... I am happier than expected.. And thank you amazon for fast delivery.\\n\",5\\n\"I purchased it one month back after comparing it with so many products. But to my surprise noice cancellation , bass and sound quality of the product is just amazing. Even compared with JBL LIVE200BT which costs around 4200 , this headphone is far better than JBL one.just go for it if you want to have a good wireless headphones in this price range.Only Con i came across is the battery indicator is not working properly it suddenly jumps from 40 percent to low battery but actual battery life is as claimed around 6-7 hours\\n\",4\\n\"Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.Sound Quality is good.Good bass.Comfortable to wear\\n\",5\\n\"Would have used hardly for 5 to 8 hours since I got this product and it does not charge now. Return window already crossed and a total loss for me. Amazon stop selling such substandard products plz.\\n\",1\\n\"This is a good quality ear phones with durable wire. But the wire is very hard not so flexiable and big compared with other earphones. This doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fit to a pocket for sure. It has a magnetic base which combines two sides when not in use. The major thing is that this ear phones once bought cannot be returned only replacement option is available in amazon which is quite disappointing\\n\",3\\n\"Just purchase it with your eyes closed man. In 1500 bucks no-one will ever give you such a Bass and good audio quality WIRELESS BLUETOOTH Earphone. Just don\\'t think so much.I don\\'t know about the lasting of the product but feeling the build it seems very premium. This is my first day usage review.===\\xe2\\x89\\xa0====\\xe2\\x89\\xa0===Writing after 5 months of usingOne of earbud stopped working without any reason today.Pathetic product I must say now\\n\",1\\n\"Dont go for this product. I have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise, the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bass,instead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good. Too heavy to use it for longer times, u might end up hurting ur ears.\\n\",1\\n\"Let me tell you that don\\'t buy this. Yes it\\'s true that it\\'s the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it\\'s not the best product YOU should buy.Problems faced:1. Battery is pathetic. Mostly gives 3 hours of playtime2. The earphones get disconnected if you even go to the next room3. Sound is too low. I have to use 3rd party Equalizer to listen clearly4. The bass is also not good. Have to rely on the 3rd party appsThe only thing is Boat has a very good warranty service but the problems with the device make it a garbage af\\n\",1\\n\"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500.\\n\",5\\n\"I am really glad of having this product. The previous one from boat was boat rockerz 400 whose sound quality with bass was just fabulous but call quality dissapointed me but this one really is excellent... I think i made the right choice of having this great product. Really awsome product with best call quality , best durability, an excellent sound quality and a decent battery backup. What else one need from a product ranging around 1-1.5 k.. Really i just loved it\\n\",5\\n\"Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me \"\"are you outside, we are getting so many noise\"\"I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don\\'t know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that\\'s matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say \"\"Don\\'t go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose\"\"\\n\",2\\n\"Got these in sale and very disappointed. I had earlier JBL wireless headphones and they were of very good quality then I lost them. Saw ad of these wireless headphones in newspaper and decided to buy as I already use Boat 400 which are awesome but I got disappointed with these, I have to speak very loudly in order for my voice to reach the other party (which looks very weird in public) and I feel that quality is also not upto the mark. Amazon I feel knew about this and thats why these were on sale and non returnable.I am now stuck with them and I DO NOT recommend that you buy these at all.Thanks.\\n\",2\\n\"Just one month nd gone. Product sucks. Please don\\'t buy. Not finding at service centres as well.\\n\",1\\n\"It\\'s been a month, I\\'m using these earphones.The product is good, still I would say for this price it could have been better.It\\'s solid & has very good sound quality.Easy to carry & smart looking but it sometimes takes a lot of time to connect with my phone & the part of it which holds it into the ear got loose already & it got out of ear a few times.. on the charging point of view it work pretty well.. 30 mnts charging is enough more than 3-4 hours continues use. All & all it\\'s good but a lil expensive.\\n\",3\\n\"<Pros>* Rich bass* Good built quality* Magnetic lock* Nice grip over neck*Good company service (had to replace it because of faulty charging)<Cons/>*Dont leave the charging cap open because sweat can get in through it and damage the charging...*Detailed review*Boat Rockerz 255 bluetooth in-ear headset is a very good quality product. It has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. Accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. If you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging, the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..*Conclusion*I would really recomend this, this headset provide a very good value for money.PS- Just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident..\\n\",4\\n\"I love these Earphones.My battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.There\\'s a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone\\'s inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.It can be used for all activities but not voice recording. So if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for.\\n\",4\\n\"These are of really good built quality(premium quality) except rubber holders and provides smooth sound quality and bass(condition is to use proper ear bud) , happy with the purchase as I used some other brand such as JBL,  skullcandy, house of Marley. It is standing with those brands .The bluetooth gets connected very easily, and u also get a 1 year insurance card for your product which gives an enhancement for trusthappy with the productPros:Good built qualityGood sound & bassEasy connectivityPerfectly fitsGood for our doorCons:I found it some what uneasy while in use (might be because of gripper I never used )*Note examples I gave for JBL and .... are for sound quality that I really consider at this point of price\\n\",5\\n\"This is a great product. Comes in a nice box and it fits perfect in ears. The sound quality is also very nice. I tested it with couple of different songs and it is too good. I was waiting to buy it and to my luck it came on sale for 999 which is a steal price!!!!!.... I am super happy with this product... I am not sure if price will be available as the normal sale price i saw was 1900+ which I guess might be little expensive but I got it for the real deal so happy happy. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x87\\n\",5\\n\"I brought this one, after using boAt Nirvanaa Uno. Uno had good quality stereo with nice bass. This is sounds like a mono headset. I think bass is too much or not set correctly. It sounds differently on Mobile  and PC. I am not satisfied with the sound output. It connects to both PC and Mobile same time, so attending mobile call and Skype call with no hassle. For Rs. 1990 there are better quality available. I trusted boAt based on my previous purchase with UNO.\\n\",3\\n\"Eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn\\'t switch to the first device connected.  While playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn\\'t work. Only it works for last device connected. We need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.Not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation.  Atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like Jabra.ANyway it\\'s light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range\\n\",4\\n\"I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here\\'s my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You\\'ll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it\\'s a good buy for the price range.\\n\",4\\n\"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.\\n\",5\\n\"Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones  Otherwise a great product to buy!\\n\",5\\n\"my  ear is goes out of order ,i am placing on line complaint but  does not go through,pls replace it or suggest me what to do . this time i am in pune(Maharashtra) and my contact mobile no is 9811917164,will give all star rating only after getting feed back from the co.\\n\",3\\n\"At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn\\'t. Noise cancellation and bass are it\\'s highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week\\'s experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn\\'t support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.\\n\",3\\n\"I bought this after searching many Bluetooth wireless earphones.Here is my review after using this product for one week with my OnePlus 6T.Pros-Battery life is good compared to other earphones.-Bass is good-Light weight even u can\\'t feel it\\'s around your neck-Noice cancellation is awesomeCons-Faced some issues in connectivity when mobile is in my trouser pockets(When holding mobile in hand,no issues at all)-Running with mobile in trousers also shows some interruption in hearing-Sometimes I hear unwanted noice (I think there is compatibility issues with OnePlus 6T and other devices too)-Battery charge is always showing 100% in 6T-Bass is good but I feel too noisy-The voice on connection and disconnection is weirdIf you are looking for wireless earphones under 1500,it is the best among the all! You can\\'t get all the best features in this price range. So go for it!\\n\",4\\n\"For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done.\\n\",1\\n\"On time delivery and product is good.. the bass wasn\\'t feeling great initially but after changing the in-ear buds with the bigger ones provided in the packing the sound was significantly better with better bass and treble. Easily connected to my mobile phone, Smart TV, and laptop. I got it on 26th October, today is 30th.. I have not had to charge it at all so far.. i use it for a couple of hours everyday.. so battery life also seems decent.It\\'s good value for money. Would surely recommend.\\n\",5\\n\"Everything is very good about this product. Great sound, I love it. However, if I I hadn\\'t lost those ear plugs and their hooks that help u stick them in ur ear I would have given it a 5 star. They gave extra ear plugs but not those hooks that hold on to the crevices of ur ear to help u enjoy the bass. I can\\'t find them separately on Amazon either. It would be great if Boat could include those in the package.\\n\",3\\n\"Sound quality is good. Bass is wonderful. Better life is awesome. There is no connecting issues. Before order I am very much doubtful about the performance of this earfone, because of reading some reviews in Amazon. But when I used this, I am very much satisfied. Amazon shipping is always good and prompt.\\n\",4\\n\"I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it\\'s doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can\\'t expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don\\'t worry about the warranty.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality isn\\'t that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can\\'t fit it in anything.Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn\\'t clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can\\'t get it in ears properly.\\n\",2\\n\"The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.\\n\",4\\n\"Everything is good, sound quality is awesome, look wise also decent but.....But battery life is bad, if you consider it for using a whole day battery may end up just before your day ends. Backup of 6-7 hours is not enough for a whole day use. If you want something with good battery life jabra elite 25e is what you are looking for but something with good sound quality this is what you are looking for but if you want both this thing in one, then sorry there is no such thing available i have searched and watched each and every earphones review but this technology seems to be failing you can even see that very few wireless mouse and keyboard have good ratings.\\n\",3\\n\"These some of the most worthy BT Headphones in its price.Pros:1. Good Bass2. Flexible3. Easy to Connect and Control4. Decent Battery Life (6-8 hours)Cons:1. Loose Ear Grip2. A bit too Lightweight3. Flimsy4. Doesn\\'t have any indciation for battery life\\n\",4\\n\"Just got the product..Amazon didn\\'t say anything about carry pouch..in the box it\\'s written pouch inside but no pouch inside..Build quality is superb as expected from boAt..Connectivity is simple.. bluetooth range is nice..it has a nice neck band..Now coming to the performance..If u r a music lover go for it..everything is great.bass is excellent..music is awesome..coming to call quality again it\\'s awesome..didn\\'t check battery life yet..\\n\",5\\n\"Best headphones I have ever bought and I have tested quite a lot of them from a lot different brands n price range.. this one simply knocks all of them out of the field in terms of sound quality, bass, loudness and battery life.. Go for it without any hesitation and you won\\'t regret your decision!And ya they stay in your ear n create a sound isolation too... Good for running too!\\n\",5\\n\"Mid range is poor. The finer sounds are not extracted.The product is extremely light and u won\\'t feel it\\'s there. This is an awesome feel. Sooper bass and crystal clear pitch. Bluetooth connectivity is remarkable. I received it yesterday and played for 3. 5 hours without and drop in performance. Seems sturdy. Yes, while listening to audio from Gaana, was getting a 3D feel, as if am sitting midst of a concert.\\n\",4\\n\"Boat is awesome if you like to hear bass\\'s and quality.I am using one plus 6 and quite satisfied with boat. In case of audio controlsDouble tap + button to increase volume & single tap for change next track.Double tap - button to decrease volume & single tap to previous track.Double tap o or middle button to dial last call, single tap 2 seconds for Google assistant, single tap immediate to play or pause music, single tap long press to on or off boat rocker or Bluetooth connectivity.If u charge daily 20 minutes it\\'s enough for long day continues music.Overall Good product.\\n\",4\\n\"For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn\\'t come off .

That time battery was 100%. It is always connected with my phone.. after using of nearly 12 hours (only connected with phone. I am not using for audio & video purpose. Approximately I have used 2 hours for audio and video purpose) now it\\'s battery is 60%.. it is okay product\\n\",4\\n\"I\\'ve been using it on runs for the last month and haven\\'t had any issues. Lately however, the earphones have stopped charging, the LED doesn\\'t work and the earphones heat up substantially when I try to charge it.I have tried to register the product and a complaint on the vendor\\'s website but always receive an error. I\\'ve tried calling them but the always receive a \\'network busy\\' error. I have emailed them and awaiting a reply.Overall a really good product but if one can\\'t get the product to work during the warranty period, there\\'s no point in buying it.\\n\",2\\n\"It\\'s been 5 days only that I have bought this product....Cons:-10m bluetooth connectivity is a myth, it only supports upto 3-5 m.-wires are not quite durable or thick.-Bass is lower than average.-not durable for long run-ears starts to pain after a use of 30min.Pros:-gets charged quickly.-light weight-gets connected quickly,no problem in connection.So, for me this product is lower than average.Now it\\'s up to you,so think twice before buying thus product.\\n\",2\\n\"This is a very convenient and easy to use earphones. I had no issues with connectivity or battery as they are both good and reliable. The sound leans heavily on the bass side of things. For bass heads who like loud earphones, this is perfect. For people who want a more neutral sounding earphones, look elsewhere\\n\",5\\n\"W/L earphone in 1-1.5K price range. Handle carefully for 1st 1 week to understand different feature capability. Had many -ve reviews on Amazon but I still opted for it. Incidentally all is well till now after 1 month use. Little problem in call/audio management but that\\'s not a major issue. Same feature of JBL is on higher price rande (4K) so not bad this one.\\n\",3\\n\"Awesome sound quality this product is really fantastic if you want to buy bluetooth headset under  2000 rupees this is the best option I would suggest really enjoy listening music through this Bluetooth headset and voice quality is awesome during calling good battery backup and prices also usually.Thank you so much boat and thank you so much for reading my review.\\n\",5\\n\"Never used a boAt product before this one, but boy was i impressed by the quality of this thing....BASS 9/10Mids 9/10highs 8/10Battery performance  9-10 hours on full charge (also has a feature where 10 mins of charge will give you 35mins worth of battery)...BT range 7-10m depending upon obstacles between this and the phonecomfort 8/10 ....(those plasticy(silicone actually) things protruding from the might feel a bit uncomfortable at first)cons: 1) has a irritating indicator for low battery which i presume goes off about 4-5 times....at 10% first then every drop in percentage after 5% will have you hearing \"\"oops battery is getting low\"\" or a similar message  2) The charging port is concealed in an awkard way...although its durable but the cover is kinda obtrusive  3) i recommend not using a power/fast/turbo charger (or whatever they call it these days) if you want to see them live longer than a month.....110mAH battery Li-On battery would def not like that [i charge mine using my laptop USB port.....sometimes i have charged it using my phone too 3% drain for a full charge EPIC for travelling]i have used many wired earphones before this so having a comparison between them seems stupid but it does well in competing with the sennheiser cx 180, jbl C200Si and it even outperforms the sony MDR-Ex150ap in terms of sound quality...also getting it around for 1400 seems like the best price ...anything higher and i would save up for sumtin elsetl;dr if this fits your budget then go for it without thinking\\n\",5\\n\"Fast delivery by Amazon. Just 2 days. Item received just today.First impression is soo well and i feel its worth the amount i paid for this item. The bass is good. It fits in the ears properly.Only i found a very little negativity is that the length of the cable. It just pops out of my shirt/Tshirt, feels little uncomfortable. Else everything is perfect with this product. 4.5/5\\n\",5\\n\"I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.\\n\",3\\n\"I read many good and bad reviews for this product and I brought it now I will review it honestly for who all are reading this review1.My product box is fully damage and reworked the box it\\'s like some one used it but the product is fine.2.The sound clarity is good only for music with extraordinary bass in it but not for movie and YouTube videos.3.Noise cancellation is not good at all it\\'s waste I still here background noise4.Not a great fit for workout session because due to sweat it\\'s run out of ear and the magnetic lock is not locking perfectly when we unplugged in ear5.its has a good battery life like there said solidly 5:30-6 hrs and it\\'s charge time is 1:30hrsThat\\'s it everything I about this earphones.\\n\",3\\n\"I bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they\\'re good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.\\n\",1\\n\"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don\\'t buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!\\n\",5\\n\"Looks bad,not stylishVery uncomfortable,Sound also not goodI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about other products at this priceBetter don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bye this productNo need to go for other reviews if u saw my reviewI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t return this item because there is only replace option\\n\",1\\n\"Very good sound quality.

Sound quality very good and decent.  BUT BATTY LIFE VERY DISAPPOINTING. DISCONNECTS VERY OFTEN AFTER 1 HOUR.SO NOT A VALUE FOR MONEY\\n\",3\\n\"Its got good bass. but it range for  treble or Mid range is lacking.If You are audiophile.. You will notice it\\'s lacking. Just one day into use.Did some tests... Yes, it lacks in higher frequencies.However with equalizer it helps a bit.Built wise good.. And will last long\\n\",3\\n\"The earphones are sleek and not bulky around the neck. Give a really good sporty look. The sound quality is very nice and not harsh. Good bass and treble balance even when on full volume.Got this product during the Amazon sale on headphones. had ordered two earphone, one was defective; hence one less star in the overall review. The other one was in great condition. a good deal for the price.\\n\",4\\n\"Battery life is good but not that great, expecting bit more for this price.Sound quality nicely clear, loud and no distortion at moderate volume.Durability is good but product looks somewhat delicate so I am not sure it can handle some rough usage.Wearing comfort is good, connecting process with phone is very easy and fast.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought one recently and below was my experience :1) the wireless range is very low.2) battery life isn\\'t good either.3) boat is known for it\\'s bass, but this one\\'s bass was terribly unpleasant.Final verdict : Don\\'t buy it. Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that \\'s much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget, go with the Jays t-Four or RHA, they are just WOW!!\\n\",1\\n\"Economic is what I would say. Not great nor too bad. It\\'s decent with performance and battery life. You can surely go for it if u not a music freak and need sound quality of high standards. A really good product for day to day use. I would say for this price - the justice has been done.\\n\",4\\n\"I had bought the earphones about 20 days back. They were working absolutely fine. They fit perfectly and sound great.But after 20 days of working they stopped working. They wont switch on. I tried charging with powerbanks, PC, chargers (I was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and I didnt exceed the limit). Now to claim warranty I have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. This is very unfortunate and I am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand.\\n\",1\\n\"Does the work for portable music listening. Needs a quiet place for the mic to work, it isnt great and I never use it for calls. Base is quite high and pains your ear after and hour of listening. If you get this around 1000 bucks, take it for a portable experience otherwise invest on a good wired in-ear Sennheiser which u get below 1500 and gives the best audio output\\n\",3\\n\"Good build quality at this price range. Sound quality is good but a little improvement will be appreciated. No battery indicatiin. No full charge indication. No option to change the male notificatiin voice to female notification voice. Glitches are too often. Battery level indication in connected phone is wrong, shows 100% and 80% then direct 20% 4 to 5 minutes before shutting down.\\n\",4\\n\"I have been using this headset for 4 months, here is my review:Sound quality - ExcellentNoice cancelation - GoodComfortable - Ear bud not comfortable as it creates pain in ear.Connectivity - Bad (Beginning it was ok but in long usage am facing too much of connectivity problems.Battery backup: Good.Bluetooth Distance: For Short distance it is good like around 7-8 metersOverall comment: Need to improve in connectivity issues and ear bud model. Ear bud can be adjustable but disconnect problem has to be focused.\\n\",3\\n\"Great product. Got it for a price of 999 only.Range- As mentioned in product descriptionSound- Quality is good unless you are a die hard music lover or music creator.Might hurt your ears on extensive use.Good for rough use.Battery life-6hrs(verified)I personally use it for working out, watching movies and listening to songs.Great value for money .\\n\",5\\n\"Impressed with this product. This one has got a lot of BAAAAAASSSSS. So if you like to burn your ears for some beats. Go for it!Battery back up is decent. 6 hours in high volume)(not recommended) and 10 hours for a decent level volume and sometimes more than 10 hrs \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8aGrip is really nice. Sticks to ears properly. The charger that we get along with the headset is a nice product. Chargers quickly in about 20 mins charge for 3 hrs playback time. Cooooool isn\\'t??? \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xaaThank you Boat alias Nirvana!\\n\",5\\n\"Still struggling to get through the customer care of Boat! Which is virtually non existent. Whenever I get to talk to their customer support all they do is promise that they are working on it and never get back. I would recommend to go for products which has a decent after sales service. Boat is proving to be the typical use and throw China product!\\n\",1\\n\"Good product. Decent sound, but Little too much of bass that it reduces the brightness of the high frequencies.Wish it sat flush in your ear but has quite a bit sticking out but that\\'s ok.Battery life is good.Easy setup and access with the controls on the side\\n\",4\\n\"The pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. But I don\\'t know which genius came up with the earbud designs. They hurt a lot! Unless you insert them deep in your ears you won\\'t really be able to get them to stay on. Inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. Therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. A great pity.\\n\",3\\n\"I was worried about the ear buds but they are very comfortable for me....Battery backup is very good last for more than a day for me(i am not a heavy user.)As for the ping is smaller than expected pubg works fine.Most importantly the sound is awesome... combined with Dolby atmos and adapt sound setting... it provide a great experience\\n\",4\\n\"Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.\\n\",3\\n\"Issues.Cinnectivity.---------------The Bluetooth connectivity is not at all good. Just breaks some times. Not at all recommended for gym workout( atleast not for cardio.) Stopped working many times when I had a good amount of sweat.Sound.I am a bass lover and always a budget guy. Till now used different kinds of in ear earphones. Senhizer cx 180.. jbl . Panasonic, boat, etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass. Atleast not while listening to music but it feels while watch a movie speciallly Hollywood.Disappointed a bit.. satisfiesld a bit.. but majorly disappointed\\n\",3\\n\"I am using this headset for more than 6 months. Purchased for \\xe2\\x82\\xb91500. Sound quality, Base everything is good for this price.Charging time: 2 - 3 hours normal charging (Not tried turbo / Fast charging).Working time: 6 - 7 hours, of music & phone calls.For music: smooth and clear sound quality. Volume increase and decrease buttons available.For phone calls: Good, i didn\\'t found anything bad.Wearing: I am using it for running, Gym, driving (Able to wear inside helmet).Connectivity: Bluetooth, automatically switch off when device not connected (within 5min)\\n\",5\\n\"First of all, for 999 it\\'s the best.So I\\'m reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is \\'decent\\'.You\\'ll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it\\'s comfortable (it\\'s light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it\\'s at the right place.But one thing I\\'d say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us \\'above average\\' that\\'s all, especially you have to be very careful with the wires.\\n\",4\\n\"Actually a product worth buying.. I have mostly been a fan of quality products than brand names.. Boat has come up with a product that does just everything it is supposed to do.. I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that\\'s why it\\'s even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!\\n\",4\\n\"Firstly the voice quality of the product is very nice compared to others at this range, however the service from boat side is not right. Mu product was damaged at the 7th day and I initiated the replacement option, the reverse pick up was scheduled however no delivery information is available still. Itz being 3 days now, when you go to boat website the tracking status button does not works on the website and even you cannot reach an representative via call. I don\\'t know if I am gonna receive the product back or not!\\n\",4\\n\"I used this headphone since 15th october ... today is 6th november ..build quality is great .. Styling is also great..I am getting 6-8 hours of battery backup with standby for 4 to 5 days... awasm battery backup..Coming  to sound quality,,, the punch of bass is just solid,, the midrange is also great,, high is little bit low,, but ok,, overall very very good sound quality... i was not accepting this type of sound quality ....also sound output is very loud...if u have a budget of 1.5k... just go for it.... u will be happy for sure.. and in this budget point,, there are no headphone that will compete this BOAT...A QUALITY PRODUCT FROM A QUALITY BRAND.....\\n\",5\\n\"Writing after 1 months of rough use .Only get detached the rubber cap of charging point.Super compatible with my Samsung Grand 2 , Samsung M20 and Lenovo Lappy.Light weight.Super sound quality.  Same as JBL as I am JBL freak . Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .Don\\'t think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you .\\n\",5\\n\"Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!\\n\",5\\n\"Terrible sound quality. I don\\'t have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who\\'s into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it\\'s only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.\\n\",2\\n\"Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money\\n\",1\\n\"Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed).\\n\",5\\n\"I like the product but some how when i open the parcel its box seal is broken. May be some one return the package and they gave me that broken seal package that i dont like, Thats is why i am giving 3 star otherwise product is good.\\n\",3\\n\"Please don\\'t buy this product. Only after using for 1 month earphones had stopped working and got it replaced within 15 days time. Now again I\\'m facing same issue with the replaced one.Had bought this earphones for jogging especially for jogging purpose however the keys don\\'t work and I\\'m not sure of these are even sweat proof. Purchased in the month of March\\'19 now facing a lot of issues as to charging, battery life, Bluetooth connectivity, ear placement.\\n\",1\\n\"I\\'m not happy that boat made these sub par headphones. They sound quality feels tinny. And the build quality was bad. The rubber casing came loose on one end after a month of use and i use it with the wire dangling out of the casing now. Not happy with this purchase. Then again, they didnt cost too much.\\n\",3\\n\"The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven\\'t tested the battery\\'s capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.\\n\",5\\n\"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you\\'re trying desperately and internationally). They\\'re lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn\\'t disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile\\'s point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it\\'s better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it\\'s competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.\\n\",5\\n\"\\xc2\\xa0Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.\\n\",3\\n\"Its my 3rd boat product..

Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.I\\'ve had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound Qualitywhomever used boat 225 in-ears headphones can understand better. If you have both 225 nd rockerz 255, you can compare the sound quality at the high volume and the clarity of songs. 225 was far better in that..And the guidelines are there only for how to switch on the Bluetooth and not clear for how to switch it off.DistanceIt was surely dislike for any one, if your mobile was in the next room then it was disconnecting again.ChargingDraining fast for continues usage, need to charge it more times. And it was not showing clearly indication of charging bar in mobile. Showing it rarely.Light IndicationIt was not clear at all. It is showing a mixed colours.MicWithout holding it you can\\'t talk properly. It was a dear distance to use.And if you continuously keep them in ears it will be paining.Please never don\\'t buy it from Appario seller. Better to buy from another seller. Even we can\\'t return the product for lifetime..\\n\",2\\n\"The headphones are justified for the price that they are available. I am using these since 15 days now and haven\\'t noticed any major drawback, except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then. Also, after connecting to a laptop if tried  to connect to the cellphone it does not auto connect. Otherwise and sound quality is good for a normal usage. Battery life is also decent around 4-5 hours of constant use.\\n\",3\\n\"PROSmaterial quality is GOOD.sound quality is great.Durable Enough.earpieces are good. Earpieces Fit properly in ears.The microphone works fine.Bluetooth connectivity is Good. Connects with both PC and MOBILE very easily.Voice Acknowledgements are great in this Earphone. ( for  switch ON,  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  . Whether you are using it for Voice or Video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture.\\n\",5\\n\"Been 2 months since I bought it. The left side stopped working gradually and now the volume has became so low..Guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better to opt for better branded products at similar price!There is literally no service centre in Bangalore for this product. Travelled like 13 kms to a place which looks more then a residential home then a service centre.. and only be told to register online as services are only done in Mumbai. Better not buy from Bangalore for convenience sake. \\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x84\\n\",3\\n\"I read most of the review\\'s before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it\\'s amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.Wire postioning is good but it can be better.The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use.\\n\",4\\n\"To those who doesn\\'t get to know the realistic review about this product.I\\'ve been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can\\'t hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can\\'t listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won\\'t miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn\\'t have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You\\'ll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.\\n\",5\\n\"I have got this for rs.1419/- and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal, sound is ok and comfortable to use, it did not fall from ear, as there is some locking type of thing, which holds the earpiece in it\\'s place, nice product. It may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple.\\n\",3\\n\"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.\\n\",4\\n\"after using it for 4 weeks it has stopped working very disappointed. After service of this product is also horrible i will defiantly not recommend this product horrible horrible experience all the money gone into waste:(never recommending your company to any one you guys are worst for sure\\n\",1\\n\"Pros: 1.light weight, 2.fast pairing for BT, 3.Comfortable fit,4.Thundering bass!! Good for bass lovers.5.Google assistant works perfectly.Cons: 1.No vibration for call alert,hence can miss a call if phone is away.2. Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem, you can install \\'\\' Black player\\'\\', which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x83\\n\",4\\n\"I have both boat wired headsets and sound magic. Both of them have rich bass. I love them totally & am using from past few years.This wireless in-ear headsets doesn\\'t have the richness in bass. May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.Except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It\\'s lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.If you\\'re okay with decent bass, this is for you.Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests.\\n\",4\\n\"It is an awesome, I really like it cause the sound quality. And the most important thing is that it won\\'t trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as I tried most of the headphones, wireless Bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if I put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. But this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won\\'t fall down from your ears while running... Amazing product. Boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... If I want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5\\n\",5\\n\"In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise.\\n\",2\\n\"The product is amazing when it comes to sound quality and the material used in the making.It works decently at it\\'s low pricing but the pannel of buttons on the headphones have stopped responding which as caused the Mic to not work as well.But still the songs play well with any issues.....\\n\",5\\n\"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I\\'m able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn\\'t like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they\\'re getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don\\'t write reviews for anything, whether it\\'s good or bad. But if I don\\'t write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There\\'s is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues.\\n\",1\\n\"*Writing the review after 1 week of use.Product is good, the brand #Boat you can trust it. Sound is amazing and #Bass for which i was excited is good enough. May be for some of you bass can be a problem but guys for a price of this plus wireless you can\\'t expect more. Also this product is long lasting.  Things i liked about this-1. design2. Bass3. Magnet4. It\\'s  durability\\n\",4\\n\"Earphones are fine but the customer service of boat company is worse .buy at ur own risk .No help will be provided and for that i hate this product.if i cud i woudnt evn hav given 1 star.\\n\",1\\n\"The battery lasts approximately 4 hours continuously if it is connected all the time. The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is good. The neck band is flexible which is exactly what I wanted. I roll the headphones easily to put them in a case. The wire is very flexible and good quality.Overall a good product.\\n\",4\\n\"Comfortable fit n good sound. My device stopped charging abt 4 months after purchase. I followed the online instructions to repair / replace the item as it was under warranty. Must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. The service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating. All electronic items can malfunction but its the after sales service that really determines the serious ones and from this it appears that boat are here for the long run. Good sound, comfortable fit, great after sales what more could one ask for.\\n\",5\\n\"I used it for the past 10 days.It is really good for watching movies and for phone calls. I love it for that.!It\\'s really bad for music. Not only this all other Bluetooth earphones in this rangeI tried leaf sport 2, leaf collar 2(sounds similar to this one).jbl 110bt (hate it can\\'t tolerate its sound quality for 10 sec).Now i am buying a wired for my music love and gaming lag in bt earphones.If movies and phone calls are ur priority go for it best in this range alternate would be leaf collar 2If music is ur love then try staying with wired ones though it seems old fashion.Honestly guys even 500 rupees wired earphones are better then bt 2k headphones. Even mi basic sounds better while listening music \\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\xb6.\\n\",4\\n\"Quality\\'s: It\\'s a best Bluetooth headphones i used, excellent bass quality, best quality loud ness, nice build quality and awesome product.Battery life comes easily 2days of medium use... Good battery lifeRating: bass 4.7/5, sound loudness 4.8/5, sound quality when hight and low volume 4.6/5, Bluetooth design 4.2/5 ( cable length is little bit long ), water proof 4.5/5 ( i am used this headphones in small rain & not problem i noticed)And final thing is you can trust the brand \"\"boAt rockerz\"\"\\n\",5\\n\"Recommended by my friend avinash as he is using from past 3 months. Now using it from last 2 month happy , satisfied , saving time. By doing simultaneous work by hand as well as by phone\\n\",5\\n\"While the quality is good, sometimes party on the other end of the call are not able to hear us. Also the external noise while is motion is high than our voice. Good for hearing songs but not for handling calls...After 6 months of usage....one side wire got tampered and no connectivity to one side now.....very disappointed.\\n\",1\\n\"Let me tell you this, I\\'ve used Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Audio technika, JBL, Skullcandy, boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I\\'m a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.Bought these earphones, I liked the build as soon as I saw them, loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.And then an amazing thing happened.I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.Button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. I did not find any problem till now. I\\'m loving it.Perfect value of money.*I wish I could have a replacement*\\n\",5\\n\"After using of 1 months :1. Bass is awesome.2. Battery is also good.3. The design is good but the wire is bit lengthy. It feel a little out of the neck.4. The buttons on it are horrible. Sound buttons are good but the middle can do nothing useful. It will pick up the call but u can\\'t disconnect it from there. Also no music forwarding after two click instead it redial the last dialled no. Shitty Configuration.5. Also after a long use , i usually get a bit of headache. Its quite often. So , i use it only when i need to other times, i had to off it.\\n\",3\\n\"Stopped working in 3 months.Claimed warranty but it takes forever..still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t received the replacement as well as no email or SMS or call from Boat.Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy these earphones...spent a little extra and buy Sony or JBL at least their products a good and if any issues they treat their customers better and resolve the issue quickly.I already bought another Bluetooth earphones and I guess I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m gonna wait for 7-8 months for Boat to replace their faulty product.\\n\",1\\n\"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it\\'s giving more than it\\'s worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.\\n\",4\\n\"No problem with design and noise cancellation but it lasted only for 45 days. The right side is stopped working. I have observed that boat product don\\'t last long even though there quality of sound is good. It\\'s a complete loss for me. I should have buy jbl.\\n\",1\\n\"Awesome product. Works fantastic. Thanks for giving the freebie. Worth the penny.Pros:Good battery lifeSounds qlty is awesome.Easy to pair and disconnect.Cons:Nothing so far.Would recommend to buy this product as its best in this price range.\\n\",5\\n\"I primarily use this headset for my daily bike ride to farm which is full of pot holes , trenches and bad roads. When I listen to music I tend to forget these obstacles and focus on my day to day goals. Day one use was okay. However now whenever I plug this with any of my Bluetooth device, I hear screeching sound just like old days mobile network coverage sound. I tried changing my mobile with other however problem continues. Also if you add another 500rs to will get jbl ones better than this boat rocker. Absolutely waste of money.\\n\",1\\n\"The product really messes up the treble. Notes sounds very muffled and some high pitched beats are audible with only very little intensity. The bass is great though, you\\'ll hear very energetic beat drops. The overall music output is still really substandard.\\n\",3\\n\"I have purchased the product on 7 Dec 2018 stopped working In Feb 2019, Reported it to boat, as per amazon, after a trial of email, the executive does not answer the call who was supposed to pick the product and drops a text that \"\"NO I AM NOT COMING\"\". I am left with faulty headphones now. What am I supposed to do with it.\\n\",1\\n\"The sound is average not that good as compared to JBL and some other great brands. The bass is more but treble is less. If u travel on a bike or cycle and wind is blowing at a higher speed then there is lag in Bluetooth connection. Overall good at the price of 999. If you want great quality sound go for JBL or boult or Bose.\\n\",3\\n\"This was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months I can say it\\'s not a good product. The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I\\'m listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn\\'t last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.\\n\",2\\n\"Hi all,This headphone I have purchased to replace my \\'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic\\' headphone with lot of expectations from the Boat. But the sound quality of \\'JBL T160 in-Ear Headphones with Mic is much better than the Boat.But the physical quality of Boat is awesome.

Even the ear bud n model is good to use..\\n\",5\\n\"First impression is good. Sound quality is good. But the grip to hold earphones around your neck is quite light. Sometimes it gets fly away when you are driving. Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can\\'t listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product..\\n\",2\\n\"Hi,Good sound quality at this price range.  I am using it just recently and has already noticed that build is not so good,  one of the biggest flaws actually. Second problem I faced is that the wire is too long,  hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear.  Here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. Who likes it!  Apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates. I would love to see it working even after one year even after so many build flaws,  after all if the product is rough and tough at affordable rates,  all this flaws can be ignored.Thanks!\\n\",3\\n\"Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don\\'t fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I  returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better.\\n\",1\\n\"When we Purchased it in April\\'2019.

Returned the product once 2nd one also had the same issue.Way of keeping them on the neck  with magnet is great.The noise cancellation is pretty good but at the same time is dangerous, it blocks out traffic noise totally.Audio is average, artificial bass dominates everything. Audio quality lacks basic details.Call quality was decent till the time there was no Bluetooth connection issues.Switched to tagg inferno, audio quality is much much better, connectivity problems are close to absent.\\n\",2\\n\"These are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. I have earlier used the Skullcandy and the JBL earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.The sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. The quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.The battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.I would highly recommend these earphones.\\n\",5\\n\"I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it\\'s the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn\\'t get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"Actually I used it almost for 3 months where I feel it\\'s better Time to reviewBattery back is awesome as mentionedBass is superSound quality is goodNoise cancellation is goodIt\\'s also can be wearable when jogging or at the time of exercise there is no tension of falling from ears which I feel so betterFor these reasons I\\'m so satisfied with the product and costI bought it for Rs 1500/-\\n\",5\\n\"The bass is amazing.

Ears are paining while using the headphones 1 hour or so.4. Battery discharge very quickly.5. While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that\\'s a CRAP.I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement. So, its better to be move towards SONY, JBL or Sennheiser Headphones.\\n\",2\\n\"I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money, quality of material is decent, battery life is around 6-8 hours. I mostly use it for office calls n response is absolutely marvelous. Earplug wires r pretty long comparative to other neck bands. Bass is good and overall a must buy in this range.\\n\",5\\n\"Please be careful. This one stopped working in a few months. I exchanged it with BOAT on their official website. I did receive another one. But it stopped working exactly after one week.

Unnecessary bass is spooling the podcast experience.\\n\",3\\n\"it has  extreme bass and a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity. It has a mindblowing battery which gives 7-8 hrs music playback time . It\\'s mic is also good & you will not be  disappointed with the voice quality. But more than putting 2 hrs it feels very uncomfortable to me bcz of its conical buds(can be removed). It\\'s Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in looking.It\\'s long wires really disappointed me. Its packaging is bad.Otherwise it is a very good headphone in this price segment.  I really liked it.\\n\",5\\n\"Great earphone in sound and built quality but not that good in range. Sound quality is great, even earphone is balanced and stays back in your neck.

Butto s are good and all functional as told.Mic is too sensitive even small pin drop in room feels like loud sound to person on other side of call.I found only range and mic sensitivity issue, even sometimes sound lags when device is in your hand or pocket.I returned it on these 2 factors only, rest are good.\\n\",4\\n\"First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don\\'t have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It\\'s just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones.\\n\",1\\n\"The product is good.Sound is almost acceptable at the priceGood bass thoughNoise cancellation is decentThe eartips are not that comfortable for long time useBattery last about 3 days as per my usage of daily 3-4 hours of useBuilt quality and design is goodLove the magnet concept, helps to keep the earphones in placeThey could have added the pause feature if possibleIf you get a good deal go for it\\n\",4\\n\"In 2 months surrounding issue...1 side is totally damaged..And not working...Want to replace...Plzz help\\n\",1\\n\"I am writing this review after using it for 2 months,  Sound quality is good, not comfortable in ears, headphones are very lightweight that you couldn\\'t wear this while driving at 60kmph, batry last for one day when fully charged, couldn\\'t change the songs from control keys\\n\",3\\n\"I bought this product in Jan 2019, and now in May 2019 one of its earpieces has stopped working. The earphones performed well while they were working. The sound quality was good, and connection with the phone remained solid throughout. Full chsrgey took around 2-3 hours and it lasted for 6-7 hours on an average.The mic is a little weak, I had to often repeat what I said as the voice wasn\\'t clear sometimes on the other end.I used them extensively for jogs and gym and they performed admirably, never getting out of the ear midway and the coiled around the neck pretty comfortably.Just expected them to last more than just 4 months.\\n\",3\\n\"I am surprised by negative reviews but I am extremely happy about the build quality, design and sound quality.Of course I am just using it for 1 day now. I will update again if needed. I hope I won\\'t have to!Note: I bought it for 1999 and in 2 days the price dropped by 500. Now they are selling it for 1499. :-(\\n\",5\\n\"Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don\\'t easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it\\'s exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected\\n\",4\\n\"Got it at 900/- at a sale and it\\'s a bang for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. The range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. The sound quality is okayish.. Neither too loud, nor too low. The disappointment is that the bass is flat. Don\\'t know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range.  Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone\\'s battery really fast. It\\'s a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!Hit Like of this helped you.. Happy buying! \\xe2\\x98\\xba\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\n\",4\\n\"One of best BT Earphones at this price range, noise cancellation is really awesome. BT connectivity is good some time when mobile is on pocket lite disconnections for Milli seconds...other than this product is good at this price range, audio sync with video is perfect.....!!! Boat is best at this\\n\",4\\n\"I bought it in Jan-2019 & it stopped working in May-2019.Build quality is good & sound quality was also pretty good.But it stopped working & charging. If I charge it for whole night then it is only usable for few minutes & then it is turned off.\\n\",1\\n\"Using for 6 months. Good battery life of 8 hrs. Sound quality is fine. Can be connected to two devices at  a time. The buttons for forward and previous tracks doesn\\'t work properly. If you are getting it for below 1500, go for it. Overall it\\'s good.\\n\",4\\n\"1) Sound QualitySound quality is very bad their no bass it looks like a copy product of boat Samsungs wired handsfree are much batter than this handfrees.2) Not suitable for gyming purposes the handfree is only good when you are sitting at one place and using handfree.If you are not stable ate one place hanfree will come out from ears again and again.3) worst customer support from Amazon they are making customers fool by giving 10 days return policy after purchasing the product you can not replace or return your product they only show that you can return your product under 10 days but actually you can not.\\n\",1\\n\"Review as below in ratingFirst of all its A Bass Boosted Earphone.not natural soundBuilt quality 4 /5......wires too thin......Sound quality 4/5......It Has Lots Of Bass frequency.....Bluetooth Connectivity 5/5... Cover more area without jerkBattary 5/5Pros... nice Bluetooth in this price rangeCons..... earphones wire too long hanging on neck it should be lil short as compare to other earphnesThis review by using 2/3 days..dnt knw abt long term..\\n\",4\\n\"Bass was almost good, atleast way better then wireless earphones of same range. Design is good magnet provided realy makes it feel great. Sound quality is good, clear sound, mic works perfect, no problem faced, amazed that it could actually connect with my phone and lappy together and swithched to phone auto when there was a call, battery life is pretty awesome, got almost 8-9 with first use, problem was that nither my oneplus 6t nor my lappy could show the ryt battery level. Got at 1400 so a pretty awesome deal.\\n\",5\\n\"Purchased almost 2 months used it roughly.....as mentioned it is sweat proof.....sometimes the conection breaks when mobile is in pocket but it is nor regular... Good bass and sound quality.....connects to 2 devices no connectivity issues.....battery lasting for almost 10 hours.....happy with the device\\n\",5\\n\"I am not sure what went wrong I used for while jogging and in a week\\'s time it is not charging. My return period has also expired yesterday 18th Feb 2019. I keep it for charging but the red light never glows and also not switching on. Regret buying this product for 2000. Advise not to buy this product very bad quality. Should have invested that 2000 in some other products. I have been a regular buyer in Amazon did not expect this type of product. Please allow me to return this product\\n\",1\\n\"I just received 255Sound nd bass awesomeBluetooth range 10 mtrs.Bill is not complete.Bill half-torn: If there is a problem in it, then there will be no problem in replacing it?If it is kept in a mobile room, then its range is 10-12 feet when you go out.If the mobile is kept out and we are out: its range is 30 ft.Received 4 earbuds.call ke time bat krne pr srrrr srrr ki awaj aa rhi h.Aaj to mujhe Mila hai.ise kuch time use krne ke baad hi kuch or bta skuga.abhi tk to ye mstttt hIt\\'s my third boat product1st boat car charger2nd boat headphoneNd 3rd rockerz 255.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is great and good bass, but disappointed with product design. Volume up/down tone is played whenever there is a change in audio stream. Example while scrolling Facebook and Instagram videos page, Volume up/down tone is played each time before start of the video. This is very irritating, looks like product design fault. I have observed this on my iPhone 6+, not sure about Android behavior.Note: this is behavior observed after device volume control is used.\\n\",1\\n\"It was my first wireless headset. sound quality is very good. ear bud is little bigger which is not comfortable when wearing helmets over this.\\n\",5\\n\"Bought this for 1999. I was hoping this would be better than the Chkoko earphones I owned. Build quality is flimsy, but I wasn\\'t expecting any better for the price. The Bluetooth connection was smooth, but the range is that for 10 feet.  Expect that to drop significantly if you walk out of the room or if there is a wall in between. Didn\\'t fit into my ear very well and felt uncomfortable.Was surprised by the distorted sound quality. I am not an audiophile but these earphones don\\'t do justice oo higher volumes and on call mic operations. Would not recommend. Returned.\\n\",1\\n\"I was under confusion about the brand \"\"boat\"\" as most of us are habituated with Sony -senhiser-jbl etc.I gave a tried and very happy about the sound output you can go for it without hesitation.Super bass and treble as like senhiser.Small part need to check from boat company that is charging point of ear phone can be redesigned.\\n\",5\\n\"Comfortable to wear and extremely simple to set up. Got a funky feel to the brand. I feel the sound has a higher bass tone, which can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be adjusted. Battery life while on calls should be better. That said, this set is really growing on me and worth the price (1.8k)\\n\",4\\n\"At first it\\'s look good. While using sometimes it fell out of the ears. I have changed all the earbuds to suit my ears but it fell of when you are looking down.Now it\\'s stopped left side. No tanglin nothing don\\'t know how it stopped. Don\\'t waste the money by buying cheap Bluetooth.I had a faith in boat because of their sound quality which they had in small budget earphones but this one is not worthyBass is medium not punchy for that bass  you can choose boat basshead  \\xe2\\x82\\xb9599 its very good.\\n\",1\\n\"Battery life is good . I don\\'t know suddenly it started to fully charged but when tried to power on its not working. It\\'s only 1 month I hardly used it and it\\'s gone no use now . Totally waste of money . I recommend not to buy\\n\",1\\n\"good quality light weight . Long battery backup.  So far I have used this for more than 20 days,  I have not faced any battery issues.  If you use only to answer the call then u will get 8hrs approx backup and music backup may vary as per ur usage.  Very good sound quality.  This is my second Bluetooth headset\\n\",5\\n\"this should have come with a disclaimer-you will never look like Jaqueline Fernandez that you find in the manual coming along with this product. What I meant is not the cosmetic beauty of hers. The wire has to be twisted before you plug into the ear or it sticks out giving you an embarassing look in the public. This I learnt after several months into buying the product. Jaqueline was lucky enough to have somebody help her with the twisting part. On other accounts,Sound Clarity - 4/5Noise cancellation - 2/5Gym compatibility(sweat, chaos) - 5/5\\n\",3\\n\"Exactly after a Week of Last day of Return, the Product Started malfunctioning.  It Does not get switched on without plugging to a power source (Some times). Automatically, the Volume is getting reduced and Increased, Automatically the Songs getting Paused and Changed in the middle.. (No touch required at all....). Mic also Not working properly. I have checked this with Other Mobile also , and got the same results.Full time u can hear the Sound of Some one Pressing the volume Button.. Beep Beep beep.I want to Return or Replacement. Very bad Experience.\\n\",1\\n\"Go for the headphones blindly if you are getting it below 1500. Such a awesome sound quality. Had been using it for almost 6 months and they are awesome I tell you.  Best part it is not like most of the bass earphones who sound is not bearable. Just a con, when connected to two devices, say you are listening to music from computer and suddenly receive a call from phone then the voice is bit shaky. Also the range is too good for a earphone like this. Best one from Boats!!!!\\n\",5\\n\"Its good for listening music or watching videos, but for calling purpose sound its JUST OKAY.Battery life is Okay not Good.I am using them from last 3 months and right side ear phone is not working.I tried to contact supplier for warranty claims but its not easy to contact him even AMAZON\\'s customer support is not helpful. Number they have given is not going through.I paid around 1500/- and now they are not working properly :(\\n\",3\\n\"The product seemed good initially (including the design, weight balance, sound quality etc). However, within 15 days of use, it has started behaving funny as it gets disconnected after 30 minutes of use (even when mobile is in my pocket). So, I can\\'t trust this Bluetooth earphone while taking official calls.\\n\",2\\n\"More than what I expected. I always brought high end earphones and lately understood that high-end earphones are not worth the price.Hence I went for this budget one (1100 rs).Its really awesome .It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quality is equal to the high end earphones I had.Never expected such a excellent sound output.There is a good balance between Bass and Treble.Lightweight and raging red colour addsup to the euphoria it creates. Unmatchable sound quality for this price and comfortable wear.\\n\",5\\n\"People having Sony or other good earphones experience, don\\'t go for it. You will not like it at all.I am personally a Sony user, but after a long time I wanted to other brand. This is where I went wrong.Honestly, people who don\\'t have Sony experience can like(mentioning \\'CAN\\') this earphone. But for those who love Sony sound, don\\'t go for it.\\n\",2\\n\"Wire length is large need to reduce it . And u can\\'t find case to keep it.so Don\\'t forgot to keep box with you.you are able to.listen very small sound.also louder in call l. Some times.while listening songs by keeping phone in pocket and moving sound getting distrurbed. My first one is not able to connect two devices at a time. After exchange I got right one .but still needs some improvements\\n\",3\\n\"It says it can connect to two devices, but, it does not. You have to disconnect from first to connect to second. And then it takes too much time/tries to connect to the second one. It also lags if u connect it to laptop and watch Netflix, if you jump 10 minutes ahead, the voice quality deteriorates heavily.Sound quality is okayish. Got it at 999, still returned it.\\n\",2\\n\"Not good as I thought. Writing this review after using 3months. Noise cancellation is not good. I purchased two headset of boat rockers 255. One of those set partially stopped working. Called amazon customer service. Waiting for replacement.\\n\",1\\n\"I wanted something to replace my TomTom\\'s bluetooth ear phones (ah, how I miss them).  While the sound quality is way better then what I derived from TomTom\\'s original set, but boat Rockerz are heavy, bouncy and needs your attention all the time while running. The heavy arms are probably the reason for  delivering the sound quality and longer battery life, but they surely are not for runners.\\n\",3\\n\"I received it yesterday, as I wanted a wireless earphones. Quality of sound is just disappointing, so much of bass, it masks all the finer tunes. I am using Sound magic E10c, which in terms of sound quality way ahead of this product. I purchased it in 1199/- in sale (these sales are just selling gimmick,I knew BoAt is just a branding on chinese stuffs like micromax, they can sell their item only on e plateform, still I thought to give it a try.\\n\",2\\n\"It\\'s good one..sound is much better den JBL..But guys u need to work on battery life.. it\\'s showing 6hrs ..Bt battery don\\'t complete the race of 6hrs\\n\",4\\n\"Worthless product distorted sound, nice basss, fatela avaj, battery life was good at starting but after some days you need to recharge battery regular, when battery percentage was 60% or below it\\'s behave like 0% and you need to recharge it, also sounds not good the coming from that little hole is like totally distorted.\\n\",1\\n\"Quality is great, the cord is longer than normal and headphones have held up for months of hard use at gym, running etc. with no damage whatsoeverSound is warm and full, the highs are not annoying and the bass isn\\'t overemphasized which allows you to listen to them over extended periods of time. Probably the best sounding pair of in ear headphones I\\'ve ever owned\\n\",5\\n\"item stopped working within 15 days,  completely dead. charging also not showing anything, reading the other reviews its clear that there are many ppl who had faces this issue with the earphones it suddenly stops working and shows no signs.\\n\",1\\n\"Durability : Left ear phone has stopped working !!This is within 25 days of buying the product. Suggest not to buy this product .\\n\",1\\n\"Hello People,Earphones provides good sound and bass. Although it not worth to have Bluetooth earphone with battery drain issues and Bluetooth range is 1-2m.I find earphone giving issues and glitches in connections in calls and sound after 2 meters.Also Battery is below average with 2-3 hours max capacity.Best of all is Amazon does not provide return on this product, only exchange option is availble.Think twice before buying this product.\\n\",2\\n\"Based on usage so far I have very few complaints. The buttons that are programmed for volume, can\\'t be programmed for media changer. And that there is no caller id in the earphones, but apart from these I love the product. Yes the sound quality or noise cancellation is not as great as airpods or high end earphones, which is obvious given the cost of the product. But for the price, the product is great.\\n\",4\\n\"worst of product weast of money,  i have purchased this hear phones 5 months back now both the speakers not working. i had raised the ticket for the same but no use.. several times i am trying to reach out custumer support not answered.Finally i realised that purchasing this kind of products weast of money and time spending to order this.\\n\",1\\n\"I used this product for like 6 months. In between one side of its earphone stopped working but boat team is too responsive as they replaced this product with new one. Sound quality is good but if you want better quality would recommend for other product. Battery life is best even using for so much of time. But facing difficulties as there always some kind of issue happening again and again. Other then its fine if it is bought under sale.\\n\",3\\n\"Packaging quality is superb... Thanks amazonAbout product-1. Sound Quality is mesmerize2. Right earphone \\'s bass output quite less as compate to left.3. Build quality is awesome and long lasting.4. Easy to connect with device.5. Neck design is superb and rest on neck with no issue.6. Earbird are proper fit in ear not come out During running.\\n\",4\\n\"Overall the product is perfectly fine from bass, terrible, noise cancellation, battery everything is up to mark. Boat is providing the best ever music quality and it\\'s for sure a product that can be purchased with close eyes.Cons**Amazon packing is worst, I have got the product with open sealed,  I was thinking about the return but though product was running alright I changed my mind to keep it so.**No casing, sometimes it became hard to keep them apart from wearing.\\n\",5\\n\"Good but keeps disconnecting sometimes when the phone is in my pocket. Also option to navigate through the songs is limited. Also not sure if the product delivered was a 2nd hand one judging by the package condition. I think better to buy from shop after inspection of seal and every thing.\\n\",4\\n\"No Noise cancellation makes it difficult to talk on call mic capturing too much of background noise, speaker is good\\n\",3\\n\"I did not like the sound of the device too much (bass is not too much as the other reviews claim).  Mine had problems connecting to multiple devices,  I had to switch it off and then switch it on everytime I want some it to connect to multiple devices. Battery backup is only about 5 hours\\n\",3\\n\"It\\'s really a good earphone. Amazon provided a great delivery, I got my product just on the next day of ordering it. I bought it for 1099 during the sales and I must say it is the best wireless earphone I have used. The functions,  Battery life,  audio quality everything is just awesome.Ione drawback is that, boat is supposed to provide a carrying case with it.  It\\'s really risky to put it in the bag or somewhere else.  Otherwise it\\'s the best product.\\n\",5\\n\"Bluetooth connectivity issues always i need boat company is not doing properly QA testing . All boat product is used to damaged very soon and thay dont have service centre as well on Bangalore\\n\",1\\n\"If only this the Bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.I use thus headphone while running. When I kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track I would often loose connectivity. I had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. I returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.I also wish they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d provide a case for safekeeping.\\n\",3\\n\"Sound quality is good but there\\'s lot of disturbance while playing music. Sounds like  music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though I am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. When they are saying it\\'s has Qualcomm technology for better connectivity then I don\\'t expect this.Another issue is battery drains too fast. If I charge fully in the morning then I need to charge in the afternoon coz it\\'s switched off.I have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it\\'s not much worth.\\n\",2\\n\"Review after 4 months of usage.Life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.One side becomes non-functional.The after service is the worst from Boat.There is no service center and there is no one to respond on callsYou may log a ticket with boat but there won\\'t be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.If you don\\'t get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then God Bless U\\n\",1\\n\"Some times sond lagsBass is good but could be betterIt gives u premium feelVery light weight,You have to handle with carebattery life is also goodNOTE: If you are purchasing it for playing PUBG mobile then dont purchase any of bluetooth earphones go for wired ones.You can see some videos to know more about PUBG gameplay with bluetooth earphoneAt last posting some pics do check it out.\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x99\\x8f\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s been a month now I am using this earphone. Since day one I am getting almost 10hours of playtime in full charge and there is no lagging in sound too. The bass is good enough. There is no connection loss at all.. worth a buy\\n\",5\\n\"After using it for 2 weeks i felt like it\\'s time to write a review about the product....Pros:sound quality is decentBattery life is around 5 to 5:30 hoursBass and noise cancellation are cool...so you can enjoy your music in all modes of traveling as well...Cons:So far I have found only one that is wire length is a bit more.If they can provide adjustable wire length that should be fine.\\n\",4\\n\"Connection issues is my main problem. Phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. And lag is awful in PUBG you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. Amazing sound quality for price. Comfortable built quality is not bad. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I gave 3 stars. I am going to use it for music mainly so I am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t but it. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend this. If you are using it for anything but music.\\n\",3\\n\"If u think of some bad product\\'s I\\'ve got. This is one of the top ones. Got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. Sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week.  Sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. The battery doesn\\'t last for more than 30 min no matter what I do. Charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference\\n\",1\\n\"Too good to have it in such price.. although it\\'s too early to comment on every specs since I have bought this only 4 days back.Till now no issue found and having gr8 experience. Sound quality superb, battery still not reached to half though have listened to music more than 5 hrs til now. Only problem is you will experience little ear pain if you put on the ear bud continuously more then an hrs time.\\n\",5\\n\"After receiving the headphone it was works fine but after 4 day\\'s it stop working one side, later on I called amazon to return the product they straightway denied the same and said you have order it from the business account and return windows is closed, it has only 3 days return window instead of 10 days in regular accounts. then I contacted manufacturer for the replacement they took the product from me in 2 days after raising the compliant but it took 20 days to get the replace product. it is very very bad. my one month product warranty gone for toss.\\n\",1\\n\"The sound quality for a bt earplugs on this budget is quite decent. If you get it less than \\xe2\\x82\\xb91500 then you should go for this. Best product in this budget.If you are a bass lover then you gonna love this. Also for calling and stuff it has got a mic which i quite good and gives a decent output to the callers even if you are driving.\\n\",4\\n\"Pros:1. Superb sound quality considering that it\\'s a wireless earphones2. Comfortable to wear3. Bass quality is also nice4. Battery backup is very good5. Noice cancellation is pretty good tooCons:1. Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity fluctuates and it disconnects/reconnects automatically2. Cannot wear while Jogging unless you find a way to stick them to one place. While running it tends to bounce off and eventually drops off from your ears\\n\",4\\n\"Pros:1. Good sound Quality with great base.2. Can feel music, great hearing experience.3. Great battery life, lasts for almost 6 hrs.  charging speed is quite good, takes 2-3 hrs to fully charged.4. Light weight, ear fit is good.5. Noise cancelled is awesome.Cons:1. Durability would be concern, needed to be handled with care.2. It\\'s water resistant not waterproof3. Wires seems to free fall n stretch, it would suggest to tie it with neckband to avoid the same.\\n\",5\\n\"Rubbish , money waste, no noise cancellation, i purchased it keeping in mind abt so many positive reviews... i was so sure abt getting it but after a week or so, it started giving trouble.. 200rs mi earplugs are far faaaar better thn this. I wasted my money, you dont do it!! Dont go by the reviews, i am shocked how it got too many p+ reviews\\n\",1\\n\"writing after using it for more than 4 months.At first lil disappointed due toh connectivity issue, many times it gets disturbance I believe could be bcos of frequency overlapping. But I want to talk about today\\'s experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them. Fitting in ear is a little problem in initial days but your ears will adjust with it. Bass is above average which is rare in bluetooth earphones.\\n\",4\\n\"I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn\\'t much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.\\n\",4\\n\"Bluetooth connection stability this device connects instantly but while jogging working out or on the move sometimes there is audio delay interruption which is unpredictable sometimes. If I\\'m using it with the phone in front of me it\\'s awesome but if you want to enjoy music on the move or jogging etc this device will dissappoint you.The battery% fluctuated.. It means at the time connection battery level was 50/60% after using it for 15/20 min in medium volume the battery gets down ivr response battery low and indicator goes totally red.\\n\",4\\n\"I purchased two wireless earphones simultaneously, Boat RockerZ 255 and MI basic wireless earphones. After using both for a week, I found that:1. Boat RockerZ 255 is comparatively higher on bass and sound quality.2. MI has a better battery longevity.3. Boat RockerZ has a more sturdy built.4. MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.I use either as per my need.\\n\",5\\n\"Pro\\'s - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery.  Cons - Extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. These headphones are useful for sports/workout only.  Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic.\\n\",2\\n\"The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another.\\n\",2\\n\"sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.build: build is pretty good and flexible.  it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt.  the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called.\\n\",4\\n\"First things firstHeadphone is very good...Connenctivity is awesome...Connects two devices simultaneously... If u r watching on one device and u receive a call on another then movie will get paused automatically...The only complaint is call quality... I had received Almost 15 calls on the day when i used it for first time.. and almost all of them asked me to remove my headphones... Bcoz they couldn\\'t listen my voice properly....So consider this before.. overall ok..\\n\",3\\n\"Perfect and strong build but sound quality isn\\'t enough.The metal was too strong.It is Water resistant #testedEven after I\\'ve met an accident its still working perfectly.But the earpiece was too big and it may cause pain in the ears.Doesn\\'t fit while sleeping or wearing a helmet.Sound quality was much better..!!A bit noisyBut everything  else is perfect..!!\\n\",2\\n\"Im a kind of headset freak, was already having bunch of wired headsets and few wireless as well. I must say that by 2k u wont get any better product than this.In all perspective be it as bttery capacity, sound clarity, when taking calls I believe it out performs all the other BT earphones atleast in 2k budgeted earphones.Have a collection of BOAT branded earphones & wireless speakers, from that experience i can honestly say that BOAT never disappoints u.\\n\",5\\n\"Pros:Nice Noise cancellation for a bt at the priceMagnetic eartipsCall quality is good with noise calculationNice bass for a bt headset at the pricePretty convenient while commuting because it\\'s a bt headsetCons:If u r thinking about playing Pubg on it, then forget it. It\\'s mic doesn\\'t work with Pubg and voice is very low.Not the best sound quality at 1500 because it\\'s a Bluetooth headsetOk battery lifeWires slightly longer than what\\'s convenient\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s one the worst product I saw... Its not working. Some prblm occurred within one month and even the repose of customer service and for  replacement if too poor. Even after the grievance no. Resposnse07015660510\\n\",3\\n\"Battery backup is average.You cannot connect it during charging.Charging time is very less.There is no way to listen it in low battery, every two to three seconds, voice comes up to notify you the battery status.But overall a good product, 3.4/5 stars.\\n\",3\\n\"I was hoping for great BASS which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( Sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do NOT remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! Over all, it is okay for the price but I already have an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset from boAt that I love and hence expected similar sound quality.\\n\",3\\n\"I have tried few other wireless earphones but beats coming from this one is great. It gives a good balanced sound and it is so comfortable that it can be used for long duration. Battery life is also good, battery is easily giving 5 6 hrs of backup. I only found one thing that can be better that it takes a while to charge the battery completely, 1.5/2 hrs for charging.I have Boats wireless speaker also and that piece is also nice.Go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is not crystal clear...On high volume it\\'s very bad...The microphone is very bad actually that doesn\\'t have noise cancellation...when ever I take a call when there is little disturbance...They other person is not able to listen my voice but he\\'s able to listen all the disturbances.I literally hate this.even I replaced but the same problem that means this product is not well built\\n\",2\\n\"Listening to Music:The sound quality of the earphones is good. The bass sounds are slightly over boosted; which may annoy some of the listeners. Bass lovers can buy without hesitation.Connecting Calls:The call quality is disappointing. The inbuilt mic is not that great. The other person\\'s voice that we hear during a call is also slightly distorted when compared with making a call without Bluetooth earphones.Over all build quality is good.\\n\",4\\n\"Ill give you honest review about this earphone. Excellent performance. Battery life very good. You can use whole day. I ordered 3 at a time from myntra at 900rs. That\\'s was a very amazing offer on it. 2 connection works perfectly. But sometimess it gets auto disconnect but again it gets connected. But this is a case of one of my earphone, not with every earphone. I have all three colours. I\\'llI recommend you to buy this, as at this price you will not find any better earphone. Overall value for money.\\n\",4\\n\"The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don\\'t do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.\\n\",1\\n\"Not upto the mark. I thought it is one of the best product.  But sound quality is average. Battery dies in just 4 to 6 hours. Getting pain in my ears as I wear this while watching movies or listening music. I thought there was some problem with the product I got first so I had to replace this item. But the product I got this earphone second time then I realised it\\'s not just one item  but the whole model is bad. In just 1 month it\\'s gone. Not charging and cannot switch on the product.I would rate just 0 star.\\n\",1\\n\"I am using this product from last 4 month and got 1 replacement as well. This device is my second headphone.What is best -Battery life - 8 to 10 hrsDurability - if you will use without folding wire this is great.Sound - Amazing.Pairing - you can keep pair with 2 devices like I continually use with cell phone and my Fire tv stickWhat is bad - No noise cancellation so its bad when you will call someone as they will keep listen noise from your side whether your Tv volume is at 2 or 3\\n\",5\\n\"Just unboxed the Boat rockers 255I am in love with the audio output.. Its simply amazingJust a bit sceptical about the genuinityNot sure if i have received a new unit .. the area where the wires connect to the earpiece seem like it was stuck for the 2nd time.Please notice in the image how well the area where wire meets earpiece near the green arrow looks well but the one near orange arrow is not... There is a white ring around it.\\n\",5\\n\"I am trying to use it for calls. But there is too much noise and other person is not getting my voice. So I think waste of money to purchase this. I can connect this device to two platform computer or mobile. But there will be noise while using it. Within a month it\\'s stopped working now. Useless product, Please don\\'t purchase it. It\\'s stopped charging now. You have to disconnect one device then you can take the call.\\n\",1\\n\"\\xc2\\xa0My first priority for buying this product is comfort level 5/5 I have slept so many times wearing this earphonesThis earphones have best fitting  5/5It\\'s Noice cancellation is very impressive 4.5/5  I am a hosteler so when I go to mess or noisy area I usually use this earphonesSound quality is good not best at this price 4/5Bass is good for me not for others because it doesn\\'t have heavy loud bassQuality is very goodRange is okk , upto 10m distance\\n\",5\\n\"Cool earphone It can cover 3 to 5 meeter range and earbuds are good take the shape of inner ear but earplugs which are fitted in ear have loosed and sometimes come out from buds so I have to very carefull about it. If it missed then it wouldn\\'t get replacement and your earphone will go in trash This is only problem with it otherwise sound quality,look,fitting in any type ear and bass are awesome....Have a Good.......:-)\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality, moisture wicking are very great. Noise cancelation is good. But I observed switching off before battery is even more than 20%. Build quality and performance are good. And very comfort to use.\\n\",5\\n\"However i haven\\'t used them properly. But one of my friend is using them. Perfect noise cancellation, great bass. Can be used for outdoors, while riding on bike. Mic is very sensitive. I think earbuds are having mic on each of them. Magnetic lock. Couldn\\'t wait for the sale to buy it for 999. I bought it for 1499.\\n\",5\\n\"I want to claim warranty....I ve issue on my wireless bluetooth headset,It was not working on right side from last night\\n\",1\\n\"I didn\\'t expected too much at this price range but I ordered it.But Sound quality is awesome .Bass is also superb. battery life is also good. I have used for 4 hours approximately but not charged once.Very easy to use.Easily connects to my mi phone and ipad.Go for it.And at last, packaging and transport is good reached before time\\n\",5\\n\"Bluetooth range is very low when compare with my Samsung Mono headset...I used for iPhone 6 but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not compatible with that in distance..it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work for me within the room only. But other Mivi bluetooth earphones workin well...I feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waste of money for IPhone 6 users...bcoz I used it only on iphone6\\n\",2\\n\"I can say 1 thing , just blindly buy this product. I buyed during the offers and I got this at very less price 999. The bass n sound is simply awesome. Don\\'t waste more money on other headsets .it\\'s the very best headset and you will love it .\\n\",5\\n\"Over all it is a below average product.-Very uncomfortable in my ear, painful after 15-20mins only.-Sound quality is very low and not clear many a time.- Bass is ZERO.-As you can see in the picture, it is on charging so frequently.- and the WORST part is; you are not allowed to return it even you want to replace it Amazon will replace it with the same product, why the hell I\\'ll order the same product again with so many flaws.Amazon atleast allow me to pick other product.\\n\",2\\n\"Got the earphones 3 days back. As with other boAt earphones the sound quality including bass is really good, but the background noise cancellation is not good. When i am talking on phone, the quality of sound heard by the person on the other side is not good with lot of background noise from my side, which doesnot happen with wired earphones or talking without earphones. Battery backup till now is good. No other issues.\\n\",3\\n\"Writing review after using 2 months of the product. Initially the sound quality was good and the connectivity was also good. But after one month of use connectivity problem started. After two month of use one day it suddenly got turned off and I was not able to turn ON the device. I registered complaint on there website and after 2 weeks they pick up the device and now after 2 week they collected for there pick up service. I will never going to buy there product. Pathetic service. Totally time and money wasting.\\n\",1\\n\"Everything going well but today sound not coming from left side i don3 know why right ear aide working fine but left side sount too much slow which irritating me now.\\n\",1\\n\"Like:LooksSound qualityEase of connect.Dislike:No carry box providedPoor packagingWires are lengthy*Today i got the product but the box was broken and the product seems to be used one.\\n\",4\\n\"Please get me refund or replacement  of my orderJust open to check my ordered piece,  but it is not getting charge neither getting connected to my deviceAlthough charged for about 30min but still problem not resolvedOn top of all odds,  charging wire also already having issue.  Not getting plugged At all.Very much disappointed, However the look and feel is really great and very satisfying.I have placed request for returning the item\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality is not that good as compare to wireShort range some time base did not come at all some connections problems\\n\",1\\n\"I have got incomplete box , there is only usb cable and earbuds\\n\",1\\n\"Wonderful Bluetooth Earphones for the price, the sound quality is equivalent to my wired LG earphones and the fitting is good too(my wired boat earphones used to easily slip out of my ears) and for the durability will have to test for at least a month, for now they look good\\n\",5\\n\"I was so excited when I purchased this Bluetooth headset. But too much dissapointed when I used. Volume is very low while listening, not up to mark and no bass at all in any song. Totally dissapointed, returned back. Not recommend for music lovers at all. Even in call , caller volume is also very low.\\n\",1\\n\"Stopped working after 1 week usage, not durable and battery back up is not up to mark. no response from customer service centre. very disappointed\\n\",1\\n\"I have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. Build quality is good. Very light weight. Sound quality is good. It has super extra bass so those who don\\'t like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone\\'s battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.\\n\",4\\n\"This is disgusting. The product stopped working in exactly 12 days. Bought on 7 Mar 2019 and the return deadline was a 10-day window. This is utter nonsense. Don\\'t know how to return this damn crap now. I\\'ll need to file a suit rather, for the benefit of greater good.Current update as on 26 April: I got the replacement product directly from Boats company and Amazon played no role or assisted in anyway.\\n\",1\\n\"Writing this review after one month usage.Product is meant for people who prefer good bass. Sound quality starts dropping once u move away from object let it be like 4-5 meters too initial it was better. As it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/\\xe2\\x82\\xb9.Actually would give 3.5 \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f\\n\",3\\n\"I like the overall sound quality of the product, just that you have to push to buttons for a few good seconds to power on or off or change to a next track. And that\\'s not too comfy when you\\'re on a treadmill\\n\",5\\n\"Sound coming off these seem imbalanced. The vocals seem to be in the background and the instruments in the foreground. Also can\\'t run or jog wearing these as the part with the buttons keep hitting your collar bone.\\n\",2\\n\"Gys sounds is very good ,can choose it blindly,bass very good in Bluetooth system,if damage after receiving or before receiving that others matter,but sound is too good.but sure register after receiving online.\\n\",5\\n\"Very bad product, i wqs fan of boat till i bought this ear phones, i bought two of these ans within 3 months one sidded stopped working of both earphones. I sent for replacement from official sites and they send me msg after 10 months that some guy from courier company will pick up fauly earphones but no one is coming since 10 days after msg, i am continuously calling that xpressbess guy but he answring like i will come this time and that time but he never comes. Worst product, worst service Dont buy.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound Quality : The sound quality is very good... Good baas... At higher volume the bass tends to overpower the vocals but at this price point the audio quality is very good.Battery life : takes around two hours to charge completely. I do not use it continuesly but it can give you around 6 hours of music playback and talk time included.Durability : around the neck design allows the earphone to be used freely... making it tangled free... durability of the wire is also very good.\\n\",4\\n\"Got it for 999 during a flash sale.The left earphone stopped working properly within a week. Got it replaced.. Thanks to amazon.The replacement is even worse. The battery dies down within 2 hrs of usage. And to top it off, the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isn\\'t covered under warranty. Even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week, the answer is same.So just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be.\\n\",1\\n\"It was going exactly so good untill three days.It showed low battery and plugged it in to the charger and since then it is not working.I did not expect this from \"\"AMAZON\"\" neither from \"\"BOAT\"\"The worst part is have misplaced the recieptamd neither do I have the box in which it came..How do I reclaim my headphones.It was excellent the sound quality was very good but the issue which I faved,I never expected this from this company of such high stature.Amazon please look into this matter\\n\",1\\n\"This is my 2nd purchase and it works as advertise. For the price this is best what one can get. Good bass, don\\'t ask for low as it\\'s just a decent wireless sport earphones. good fit, has some extra pair ear buds.\\n\",5\\n\"The sound quality of the earphone is good. The base and the noise cancellation is commentable. But I am not Satisfied with the products durability, just usage of 6 months and one side of it is not working. I really am a BOAT fan, but this product didn\\'t survive as per it\\'s name and money. You will find better earphones in same price range or you may have to Shell out a little bit more. Overall rating is just above average for this earphones just because of the durability.\\n\",3\\n\"Pros: Excellent sound quality for this price.. I would have not returned it, if it had continued to work well.Cons :  Stopped working 15 days from the date of purchase. Also, my phone had to be almost near the headphone for it to work well.\\n\",1\\n\"Sounds quality is very nice...it has a good bass and the build quality is also nice considering it\\'s price but the range of connection is very poor... Even if it is very close to the device the music gets cut a little which is annoying sometimesEdit: I exchanged the one I received with a new boat rockerz 255 and this one has no issues. The one I received earlier was defective...Changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x83\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x83\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is very good more than expected from a 1499 earbuds. After a long time enjoyed music. Bass is ultimate. Call quality is very good indoors. Didn\\'t test it outdoors yet. I watched lots of best bluetooth devices video reviews and this one is listed in top 3. Hence considered buying it and it has turned out to be a good decision. Happy with it. Will test it more and update. Hope it will give a good battery life. 110 mah should last long\\n\",5\\n\"The product is good for the price i paid 999.but i have a doubt whether its an original boat earphones.cuz the brand mark is nowhere engraved.just printed on the band.and its a long than expected..And Guys the battery backup is just 2-2.5hrs\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s noise cancellation isn\\'t very effective. U need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. Also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it\\'ll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn\\'t. Good in terms of bass and sound quality. Overall it\\'s an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing.\\n\",3\\n\"I like the whole package(build quality, packaging, earbuds ,light weight, super comfy) the battery is good..it\\'s all comes to the sound quality....for a Rs1200-1500 earphone it\\'s too low....it\\'s all bass...nothing but bass...nobody wants that much bass..used loads of other earphones..sound is too bassy...otherwise descent product\\n\",5\\n\"The product is super but it is not robust. The earphones does not last long. I bought it on Sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. The customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. Again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. Sound quality is awesome. One cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use\\n\",3\\n\"It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have.\\n\",5\\n\"I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn\\'t fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can\\'t use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I\\'d say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I\\'m having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I\\'m really starting to think if they\\'re worth it because of this durability concerns.\\n\",2\\n\"Merits:-1. Been using it for last 2 weeks. The earphone\\'s sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can\\'t hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.\\n\",4\\n\"Hi, I bought this on 5th Feb and it stopped working on 16 Feb 2019. I am chasing people to at least get the item replaced but not sure if they will help on this. On 16th Morning, it neither switches on nor it charges when trying to charge.Very bad to see 2000 rs going in vain.Mohit\\n\",1\\n\"I dont lik that Bluetooth connectivity of this product its easily lost the connectivity with in 5 to 6 meter even company claim that 10 meter of connectivity and microphone not good opponent Cannot hear voice properly they telling u need to talk loudly even m loudly yelling opponent can hear voice very low amount rather than normal phone talking microphone is worst otherwise may be this product has problems i want original product with proper replacement and dont want defective product again\\n\",1\\n\"I got it for 1000 which is great getting this earphones at this price is really great .sound quality is also good , base is really good here , the quality of sound is also goodbattery life: it last long for like 5-6 days for 1-2 hours per day usage .\\n\",5\\n\"Like the sound quality ,and durability of the product, should have been better if the design of the earbuds were like of that of iphone earbuds, once inserted in ears you will not be able to hear outside sound.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. They are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don\\'t even feel them. The battery life is also good. Most importantly if you work out or run then you don\\'t have to constantly worry about the wire being pulled. So for \\xe2\\x82\\xb9999 these are a good catch.\\n\",4\\n\"Faced 2 issues :1. I tried all three different sizes of earbuds but they don\\'t fit in perfectly in my ear and keep falling out.2. While taking a call, the other person keeps complaining that my voice is echoing. I like to use earphones while taking a call, so half the utility of these is lost.\\n\",3\\n\"I bought these earphones one month ago and today it\\'s one side Stopped working, overall headphones are best at this price, sound quality is also very good, bass is very high which is very good, but it\\'s built in quality is somewhat lowAs I said it\\'s one side Stopped WorkingBut I claimed warranty and boat is now replacing me these earphones, hope the replacement should not also stop working\\n\",2\\n\"Stopped working after 1 month\\n\",1\\n\"I made a mistake buying this item. It hardly gives 2 hours for a promised upto 6hrs. That is just half of it. Once full charged I checked it, but after two hours battery is dead. The sound quality is average, built quality is decent but the battery is too bad. I am thinking of replacing a new one.\\n\",1\\n\"The sound has more of bass and very little treble effect. If you like to listen to your music with slightly higher setting of treble, you will be disappointed. Battery is very good and so is noise cancellation. It\\'s quite big and sturdy though, will not go unnoticed.\\n\",3\\n\"the headsets are comfy and the design is sleek regarding sound the headsets handels most of the back gound instruments just fine not great just fine the base is so much that it interferes with the voice of the vocalist the sounds gets suppressed while the base is just loud the voice also cracks sometimes if you listen closely overall not for everyone but great buy.\\n\",3\\n\"Great battery and good audio quality. I love it. This is goes with me to office, shop, market everywhere.- Good connectivity.- Good audio quality of bass and treble.- Good look- Great comfort in wearing for several hours.- Good battery.\\n\",5\\n\"Poor connectivity, even distance is less than 2ft. Voice break in call and sometimes in music. Tridled with few different phones to make sure no compatibility issue, but all time connectivity issue. For this high price, not upto mark. Box packing was used. Seems like supplier keep rotating faulty used item.\\n\",2\\n\"The best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.However, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use.But if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone\\n\",4\\n\"As I get these for jus Rs. 999, the sound quality is great for me in this price range with wireless connectivity.It gives me more then 6 hours of battery backup on every full charge ( got discharged in between 6-7.5 hours depending on my usage).I m happy that I bought it. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is average. Bass is below average... horrible experience using this. After 2hrs of usage ears starting paining... Bluetooth range is around 5ft only after that it fluctuate. Noise cancelling is good. Wires are bit longer so it looks ridiculous. and on using this earphone on above medium level of volume it lasts for around 3 hrs only... Overall please don\\'t buy it go for other options with lighter weights of earphones.\\n\",3\\n\"Bought Boats Rockerz 255 recently and its upto mark. Works flawlessly with my OnePlus 3T. Sound quality is surprisingly good with good amount of bass and treble. Also battery backup is good.Highly recommended!\\n\",4\\n\"Nice product... but a bit high price.It could have much better sound quality at this price. I have always loved \"\"Boat\"\", it is one of the best product of boat but could be better. Sound quality is average... not upto the mark. I was expecting it to be more clearwith better base n treble.\\n\",4\\n\"Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat. Too much noise in the background. It even got replaced once but no use. Now they have only replace option and no refunds. Waste product. Don\\'t even like it. It\\'s just fallen in my drawer everyday and I don\\'t feel like using it at all.  DO NOT EVER BUY BOAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY.\\n\",2\\n\"First impressions with one day usage.Pros :--1. Extra Bass.2. Battery (got around 8 hours from out of the box without charging even once)3. Good connection.4. Comfortable.Cons :--1. Build quality.2. Wires are little bit long.Go for it if you are looking at Bluetooth Earphones under 1.5k. I got it for 1,299/- rupees.\\n\",5\\n\"This product stopped working. But when I put it on charging it is working fine, seems issue with the battery . I purchased it by seeing the review but now i regret buying it. I have sony earphones which is working perfectly even after 2.5 years. I will Never use boat again\\n\",1\\n\"Quality is very good in this price range. Bass is superb. I mostly use it for workouts. It does the job well. I face problem about noise cancellation as the other person on phone always complaints about unnecessary sounds from the sorroundings when I take a call outdoor. Service delivery from boat is amazing and satisfactory. They replaced my headphones after 3 months as one of the buds started sounding low.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that\\'s why one can\\'t experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some  designing faults i can see that\\'s it.\\n\",4\\n\"I got the in month of june.... Suddenly right side had stopped working.... Can u help me for replacement.... As itz showing 1 year replacment warrenty\\n\",3\\n\"This is my replacement order and facing same issue. Other person can\\'t here my voice properly during the call via Bluetooth. They can only here background disturbance even i sit in room. Eco problem! Deciding to return and order some other brand. This is only good for music.\\n\",2\\n\"Awesome product at this price..the sound quality is very nice, noise cancellation is very effective which makes it very useful for those who use it while travelling. The ear support curve is very comfortable, you can use it for hours without having any pain in the nearby area. Overall good product, stand very high amonst his peers.\\n\",4\\n\"With in few months one side of head set is not working.  I am not able to find service centre in chennai and in online centre green and black model is also not displayed for selection.\\n\",1\\n\"Received the package on time.The headphones package is basic.No case which is little disappointing.1.Sound quality is awesome,bass is really nice, sounds is loud.2. Call quality is also nice.3. Bluetooth range is not so good.4. Battery life is awesome. It last for atleast 6hours of music.5. Durability is also nice, as it is also water resistant so a big plus point.A must buy budget headphones at this price range.So a big 5*\\n\",5\\n\"It\\'s sound n noise cancellation is good , Battery Backup is good too. But after using for 1-2 month it one side shut down suddenly n also the caller in front can\\'t hear your voice it\\'s mic is below average. Also I faced Bluetooth range problem when I connect it to my phone and keep my phone in my pocket it just disconnect....I have place a replacement. So let\\'s see\\n\",3\\n\"Hi guys....the product is good. Gives a battery backup of around 5 to 6hrs and takes nearly 1hr to 1hr 30mins. You can use it while working out in the gym. The sweat doesnt affect the device.There are some issues with the product. You can hear some disturbance many times. Bluetooth connectivity range is around 5metres only.Overall a nice product at this price range. You can go for it if you are in a tight budget and also want a branded product.\\n\",4\\n\"Whenever i call somebody then the ring sounds very poor. It feels like watef is there inside the soeaker of headphone/earphone. It creates too much irritation. Along with this i couldn\\'t experience any noice cancellation/reduction feature in this because during call (the people with whom i was talking), they were saying some disturbance from your side and the same I was feeling. So overall for listening music its good but for calling purpose its not a nice product to buy.Thanks\\n\",3\\n\"Basic wireless headset with mic. Sound quality is average. Had expected good bass as its from boat.. but was disappointed with the bass as well as the sound quality which sounded artificial. Batter backup is good and also the make quality is good.  A 3 star product.\\n\",3\\n\"Product function buttons are not working..service of Amazon is also not reached my expectation. Returned the product stating the issue again got the product after 3 days with same defect... They got benefited by getting the feedback from my side.. and me roaming here and there for collecting the product, returning the product and eagerly waiting for unworthy piece...if they are not allowed till the place mentioned in the address...they should tell beforehand...\\n\",1\\n\"I bought this in amazon sell with sbi card in 900 rs. First, the bass of sound is very good.noise cancellation is good.  All other features like buildup quality, ear fitting, etc are above average. Not bed but don\\'t compare with costly one. Finally one line- good one batter then all other brands up-to 2000-3000. Value for money if you buy up-to 1000-1100.\\n\",4\\n\"Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price.\\n\",4\\n\"Cons:1. No vibration on call.2. 6-7 hrs battery drain in not use but connected state.3. Wires are longer than it looks, so they are hanging around while in use.4. Inear support is useless.Pros:1. Bought for 999 which just okay.2. Sound is okay.Would suggest Samsung Level U for 2000.\\n\",2\\n\"This product is not good and compatible with iphones. Sound quality is very low, on call sound is worst and phone battery is draining like anything. Twice ordered (using return option) but both the sets were same issue. I do not recommend this product for iphone. For other phone may test and try.\\n\",1\\n\"I am facing problems with mine one...i dont know why bt the left earpeice stops working automatically sometimes...i jst ordered for replacement...bt now m afraid...d if d replacemt product works d same way....den my 1500 rupees will be a loss...if any of you face the same...please let me know\\n\",1\\n\"Excellent headphone for calls and music. But if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. As it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. Like when i play pubg using this headphone, I get sound delay. So sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. No issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. And you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. So go for wired if gaming your priority.\\n\",4\\n\"Very bed\\n\",1\\n\"Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.\\n\",5\\n\"The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw.\\n\",3\\n\"IF you are bass and Treble lover, these wireless earphones are for you. I bought this for Rs 1499/-. I m using it with an Iphone and i enjoyed the output.Positive part: Great Design, Good output for given budget, Noise cancellation  is good too.Negative Part: I experienced Bluetooth connection disturbances wile exercising, U need to use equalizer settings if u do not love Bass and treble.Overall it is a good product....\\n\",4\\n\"The product has decent build quality which makes it durable. However the cable is too long which makes it look a little weird hanging around your ears. Battery drains quickly. Sound is amazing, perhaps the USP of the product. Not good for bike riders as wearing a helmet gives pain in the ears.\\n\",3\\n\"You can take this as a bluetooth version of boat wired 220/225 headsets.Sound and bass is great but not clear in few situations.Noise cancellation was worst to the core voices of people 10m away from you is clearly captured and irritates you to the core, don\\'t know whether it is a product issue which i received.I missed to notice with in the return duration otherwise would of replaced it.Now i need to reach support team for replacement.\\n\",3\\n\"Price is best.Worst battery life.Four years back, I purchased Nokia wireless earphone, which had option save battery when not working, but Boat don\\'t have that yet in this earphones.If you are using apple earphones, then you\\'ll not like bass of this Boat earphones.\\n\",2\\n\"Waste of money, people who all reviewed it as great seems they rated it for no good reason1. Sound quality is extremely poor and it feels like a local headphone which is sold in the market. NOT upto the mark.2. Battery drains in no time, charging hours compared to listening hours will be less.\\n\",1\\n\"It fullfills all requirement of music lover, action movie lovers, those who talk for long and those who listens audio books.Bass is high, it depends on choice. But it doesnt kill trebel, mid and high tones so listening is wonderful experience.Connectivity is very fast and battery backyup is 6hrs+ in playtime.Rest all is good.\\n\",5\\n\"It was amazing product. Base was nice. It last for more than 6 hours.I didn\\'t get any USB charging cable with the package.\\n\",2\\n\"I didnt expect this much from boat.I got this for 1499Sound quality is good and the Bass is deep( great)Fits so perfectlyButtons are very reliableBattety is good (  only used for 2 days)Its very worthy on this budget...Honest review\\n\",5\\n\"Damn good value for money and sound quality is excellent.  Noice cancellation quality is great. Only thing is the ear plug wire length is bit too long for my liking. Wish they could have shortened the length of the ear plug wire of the neck brace.\\n\",4\\n\"This product\\'s sound quality is impressive. The tagline speaks for itself - immersive stereo sound is truly what one gets. It charges quickly, and lasts for a long time (5 - 6 hours of use). I also own an Audio Technica M50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. Note that these headphones costed north of \\xe2\\x82\\xb99,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt.\\n\",5\\n\"It\\'s my first day of use and the product is overall good as expected but just one dissapointing thing is the Bluetooth connectivity it cuts off in between which is not pleasing when your listening to songs otherwise the sound clarity and bass is no doubt quality and up to the mark just the connectivity factor is something which bothers me let\\'s hope it gets better in days...\\n\",4\\n\"Yaa,product quality is not that much Good,it was showing the Bluetooth range is approximately 10metre but in my case it is working well within a range of 3/4 metre,if I go beyond this range the music/Calling quality is very bad.I don\\'t know why the company like Boat having this much poor music Quality,But is doesn\\'t satisfy value for money.Thank you..\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x9f\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x9f\\n\",3\\n\"After many research I bought this earphone thinking that it is best Bluetooth earphone at best price. Initially it worked as expected but after two months of normal use, it\\'s earbuds and hooks went off. Then suddenly its left side earpiece stopped working. I used  this one with care as mentioned in manual and used for only two hours a day every day and two. Very very disappointed. I guess they compromised the quality to compete with competitors price.\\n\",2\\n\"One of the best in-ear phone that I have ever used it so far.. This one rely rocks..Amazing sound quality and one of the lightest ear phone suits very well for most of the sports activities...\\n\",5\\n\"I\\'m not too much of an audiophile but I do look for proper instrument separation, clear vocals and a good bass.The bass is really overpowering. If you\\'re into that, then great but I honestly hate it for that.However, battery life is great! And seems pretty durable. Fitting is good, with 3 bud size options. Pairs easily.\\n\",3\\n\"Just good, always facing problem while connecting to other devices like laptop or other phones of Bluetooth version 4.2Too long wire, not much comfortable.Battery percentage of earphone also showing wrong in phone. It shuts without notification of low battery in phone.Notification language for power on, power off or battery low is also not clear in earphone. DISAPPOINTING\\n\",2\\n\"Pretty good product. Clear sound.Only complain I have is every time you turn it on it announces \"\"hello, power on. you are now connected to boat rockers\"\". Consider this announcement when you are halfway through in an important call and are connecting to Bluetooth now. Not that other parties hear the announcement but you don\\'t hear anything from call while the announcement is on.\\n\",4\\n\"Pros:Easy to useGood quality material usedConsNoise Cancellation is very poor. The person on the other side of the call will hear person speaking next to you in a public place, rather than you. I\\'m extremely upset with this and hence would like to return it.Ps: Doesnt make sense to save few bucks and buy a sub standard product, instead opt for some other brand\\n\",2\\n\"I\\'m really love it... Bass lovers pls go for it.. Now I\\'m really a fan of boat headphones... Lite weight.. Battery life is good it\\'s giving continues play back of 6-7 hrs.. Perfect fit... If u guys looking for a Bluetooth headphones under 1500 just go for it... Really worth it..\\n\",5\\n\"Sound is good, Noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. One thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing Helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x90 If Boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!\\n\",4\\n\"Nice product at a price of 999. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good. Only problem I have noticed is that whenever it goes out of my Mobile\\'s range, even for 2 seconds, it doesn\\'t get connected automatically and I have to connect it manually again. Rest all looks ok.I am using it for 3 days now and battery life, call quality etc is satisfactory.Can\\'t comment on durability at this stage.\\n\",4\\n\"I have just bought it and hardly used it 3 times...Now these has started to give a \"\"hissing\"\" sound after connecting it to my device...And main thing is it is not connecting itself to my PC I have tried a lot..but these are not good..Such a bad thing by amazon India ...I have never expected this thing from amazon...Please don\\'t buy these stufs from amazon....So bad...\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x94\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xad\\n\",3\\n\"Best headphone for this price range mids, bass and treble are at good tuning. Bass is a bit Punching which is nice for bass heads. There is no big lag in time but found a little lag in gaming audio. Neckband is extremely light weight can\\'t feel it like wearing and flexible too.\\n\",5\\n\"Completely perfect product. Sound quality is really awesome. I\\'m real sound quality seeking guy. The product meet my requirements. Super bass and clear sound as well. It really plays all kind of frequencies. Noises cancelled by 97%. It\\'s genuinely toched me. Thank you BoAt. Thank you Amazon.\\n\",5\\n\"Please read it before you buying1. Sound quality is good but not loud enough2. Battery is good3. Bluetooth connectivity is good4. Wire is too longBut the main part, it is a headphone and you should put it on your ear, but believe me after using 10 min you feel pain in ear, frequently it fall from ear, it is not light weight so it irritating your ear and head. So please buy a light weight headphone to do the main job.\\n\",2\\n\"I got it yesterday,used it for mrng walk,quality is good,very comfortable to wear,call quality is good but not great,Base and vocals are clean and neat,noise cancellation is good enough,but what i found was there is lot of disturbance and noise while playing music online,sometimes i felt like it is getting disconnected for a fractiin of second, then playing again,thats d only thing i found in cons, but overall a very good buy in the price range.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought this product three months ago, and until now I\\'m satisfied with the performance. It\\'s battery life is amazing, one single full charge can last upto days if your use is average hours per day.Sound quality is good bass is little on the low side. It has water and sweat resistance, makes it very easy for me during exercise, without the fear of damage to my product.It comes at an optimal range, buying it is win-win.\\n\",4\\n\"I have purchased this product 2 months ago now after using i can say this nice product in this range...sound quality is good, just need to improve battery life bit more,once you charge you will get 2-3 hrs maximum backup.You can add only one device at a time although there are other Bluetooth headphones comes with dual connection.There is no magnet or any kind of knot so you have to be very careful every time when you are not using\\n\",4\\n\"I liked the product..... But carrying pouch is mentioned on the box but not in the box...... Also I didn\\'t receive extra set of ear buds.. there is also bluetooth connection problem .... Sometimes it disconnects\\n\",3\\n\"For the price these are good, the sound quality is decent, not awesome noise cancellation, but at this price this is one of the best in Bluetooth. The battery life even after using it for 3 months is very good, i keep them on the whole day and recharge them at night.\\n\",4\\n\"Bought on 8th September 2018With in 4 month both ear buds are not working. I made a request for replacement after the 1 month I got the replacement for my earphone .I got new earphone from boat .After 2 month I could not be able to charge my earphone ...both ear buds have problem I could not be able to hear sound clearly .Don\\'t buy it .I have worst experience with boat.\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality is not bad, but not as expected (compared to wired boat earphones).The battery life is considerably good, its as mentioned (6hrs+)I found little lag in sound of around half a second(~300 to 400ms), while watching a movie which made me to give 3 stars.The product physical quality is appreciable, good quality of thick wiring is used.\\n\",3\\n\"Don\\'t buy these type of products seriously. Recently I bought this boat rockerz bluetooth headphones it had worked very nice for 1 week only afterwards a lot of disturbance while talking in a phone for that i need to replace it.

The base is high. It is not fitting in years comfortable. It coming out. Sound quality is ok but not too good.

Its really awesome and I am loving this Earphone easy to connect with awesome sound quality. If connected on call it works well and reduce the noise I mean noise cancellation works well. The person I was speaking to cannot identify I was using Earphone. Its value for money.\\n\",5\\n\"It\\'s slightly loose in case of fitting. If you move your neck continuously then it will come out from your ears. Sound quality is too good. As expected from BOAT.  The main issue is after sometimes of connection via bluetooth,  the rockerz 255 disconnects automatically.  Don\\'t why. Except that it\\'s a very decent earphone in case of sound quality.\\n\",3\\n\"NOT BAD.BEST BLUETOOTH EARPHONES IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT.NOISE CALCELLATION IS EFFECTIVE TO A EXTENTSOUND QUALITY IS GREAT.BATTERY LIFE IS AWSOME.

Otherwise Great product for its cost & better then competition\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is very bad and signal reception is very low. If I keep my phone in my trousers pocket while wearing headset, it usually doesn\\'t work. I have to keep mobile in hand to listen to a song without frequent hiccups. The performance is worst during calls, i dont understand the problem but i receive weird disturbance while someone is speaking at other end. Its very frustrating to switch back to earpiece mode and listen again\\n\",1\\n\"Good battery life. Bass is kind of overpowering. The earplugs that come with it was too uncomfortable for me. Maybe fir others it would fit better. Overall I would rate it 7/10.\\n\",4\\n\"Instant of spending 11k for airpots....i buy this one.....at this price it\\'s look good.....lack of bass....last for 4-5 hr......for me at this price u can\\'t get better than this\\n\",3\\n\"I have ordered this for 3 times. Only once I have received good one. Other two times I have received with open box and missing attachments. Once I returned also and ordered new one but again I have received with tempered box.\\n\",1\\n\"We\\'re using this product for a month now. It\\'s really good. I was using Samsung level U but the wire snapped. This one is pocket friendly, flexible and worth buying. I went by Amazon choice and for the first month I\\'m really happy. Hopefully it works like this for a long time.\\n\",5\\n\"I have had a very bad experience with these. A month after using these the left ear bud started distorting and the volume control started heating up. I had written a complaint and they were exchanged within 15 days. Yes, they have really good customer service. But even the new device started malfunctioning in a similar manner, really disappointed after seeing that. But I have got to say that Boat has really good customer service.\\n\",2\\n\"Product got deliver timely. Sound quality is very good when listen music or from YouTube.Battery backup last up to 4-6hrs depending upon usage. Thanks to boat bluetooth speakers.\\n\",5\\n\"Got this free with Huawei Y9 2019, claimimg that they are 3000 INR earphones. The sound quality is worst with Huawei Y9, Zenfone 3, MI devices. Not even worth 3000 INR but works good with lenovo devices.\\n\",1\\n\"Everything else is great but the major issue with this earphone is its very hard for ears and your ears will start paining within 30 mins of usage and i also tried all 3 earbuds which come from company but still the same issue. Also there\\'s no refund policy from Boat only replacement will be given. So don\\'t buy as I\\'m regretting my decision.\\n\",3\\n\"This is the best bluetooth earphone under 1k price segment. Offers good sound quality with perfect bass. Design looks cool and light-weight, overall its a perfect fit.The only problem is with its ear log fit.Go for it :)\\n\",4\\n\"The product is quite sturdy, flexible and has great music quality but unfortunately the absence is noise cancellation makes the caller on the other side to listen to more of the background noise and voices than yours.\\n\",5\\n\"Pros:-1. Sound quality exellent.2. Battery backup good 7 to 8 hours but it\\'s intial days.3. stylish and light to wear on neck.4. I got it at 999 rs onlyCons:- 1. previous and next buttons are missing, which are even available in Chinese scraps 2. Mic not working good, have to speak louder or repeat.\\n\",4\\n\"I want to tell everyone I was so confused to take wirless headphones or bloothooth headphones. But now my confusion is totally cleared... One time investment Boat headphone. I want to must say BOAT headphone are very reliable and very clear sound with superb base. This is not only me talking about headphone my brother also having BOAT wire headphones and he is very satisfied... Thank u Amazon... And for one day delivery  thank you so much\\n\",5\\n\"After using it for 3 weeks I\\'m giving this review.. i bought it for 1200.. Sound quality is good with more bass.. if u don\\'t want that much bass means u can change the hear bud to a smaller one.. Quality of the product is also good i guess it will be a durable one.. Battery life is ultimate.. If u use it for 3 hrs a day it will last for 1 week.. Since I\\'m using it for my gym I feel very comfortable with this battery life..\\n\",5\\n\"These earphones are awesome and there is no trouble with them. Those who are saying that they don\\'t have bass are wrong i have used them and the bass is seriously pretty strong for wireless earphones in such a price range. They are not over priced as well. Moreover while talking over them the person on the other side also didn\\'t face any difficulty hearing me. These earphones are great, I personally highly recommend these.\\n\",5\\n\"I have heard better sounding headsets and was honestly a bit disappointed for the quantity of sound. The mids and lows are not up to the mark. It\\'s good for voice only application.\\n\",4\\n\"I listened to the songs when I plugged the charging chord, i couldn\\'t believe the awesome quality sound it gave me. I discovered fault after exactly 15 minutes of unboxing it. The battery is faulty. Only works when power chord is connected. Filed for return and replacement exactly 1 hour after reciving it. Giving only 3 stars due to faulty product. When it comes to sound quality nothing can beat this earphone.\\n\",3\\n\"Let me tell you very frank bass is quite good not great, connectivity is worst, battery is average, expectations is high for my side as per brand but its response totally fail , disappointed me.last but not the least when i open the parcel seal is open  and box packaging in parcel is damage.\\n\",2\\n\"Overall worst product from boat,poor connectivity,it get interrupted 5-6times in a 7min songs and keep repeating that same irritating voice-you are now connected to boat rokerz 255,Battery backup is goodBass is so soI suggest, choose any other product instead of wasting in it.\\n\",2\\n\"One of the worst product I have ever brought. In 3 months stoped working!. I recommend not to buy this earphone. Everything else like sound quality, noice cancelation are pretty good. But if the durability is less everything else becomes waste.\\n\",1\\n\"This is the 4th product of boat I have bought and this is as good as the previously bought headphones.In this price range these are far better than any other brand.Pros.Battery backup is very good.Bass is excellent.Sweat proof.Very good build quality.Cons.Packaging can be more better.\\n\",5\\n\"Good bass and sound at this (1000-1500 Rs) price.Pathetic battery indicator, it will show 100%-80% till 4.5-5 hours and suddenly low battery indicator blinks.Avg battery backupDecent looks\\n\",4\\n\"This headset is okay. Doesn\\'t have a very good sound quality. Go with Mivi collar if you want better sound quality. But if you have budget of Rs 1500 then these are fine.\\n\",3\\n\"I\\'m giving 4 stars as overall because the product is all good but the packaging wasn\\'t satisfactory. The box was bit damaged fortunately the product wasn\\'t damaged. Sond quality is above average but the better thing in such price is IPx5 sweat resistant. Noise cancellation is good too.So try to order this separately for better packaging service rather than adding to your cart and buying more than one product.\\n\",4\\n\"I WAS ALREADY USING boat rockerz 255 before buying this item, but its not of that quality, it doesn\\'t say boat rockerz 255 after pairing, sound is to loud like an ordinary earphone, no voice cancellation feature in place, moreover what is hands free mic I did not receive it, I was looking for surround sound as described in your \\'MORE DETAILS\\' it\\'s disappointing to say the list\\n\",1\\n\"Disappointed with the Experience. The selling point for me was the battery life and the sound system which was expected to be good. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really disappointing. I tried to give these away to another guy for free who returned it to me for freeAnd I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even return this product! I can only get replacement!

Always have to do it the other way, which fixs the issue.\\n\",4\\n\"I have been using since 1 day and build quality was great , I use boat rockerz 225 headphones which has very good bass when compared to this but at this price range it is bestPros:\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x8b Battery Life was simply superbbConnectivity is fastSound quality is good and bass is punchyBuild Quality Is good as per price of 999/-Cons :Wire is long\\n\",4\\n\"Awesome !!!Go for itThe angle of ear tip makes extremely comfortable and with best noise and the secondary holder on top cancels every external noise and makes it perfect for sports.I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used it for Gyming,badminton,table tennis and for movies and web series.And Working of Siri is superb and does  every task I have given to Siri through earphone.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound Quality: Insane bassBattery life: a bit mediocre but given the price and build quality, it\\'s cool.Durability: I\\'ve owned boAt products before, I can vouch for it\\'s build quality.Verdict: Packs a helluva punch when it comes down to audio quality and fits into the wallet pretty well. A must recommend from my side. Research the product tech specs on the internet for more information.\\n\",5\\n\"Absolute Rock Star! No problem in paring with any phones, tried with iphone,samsung and pixel2. Work flawlessly. Great sound and bass effect. Great noise cancellation. Overall a 5 star product.\\n\",5\\n\"Overall its a good deal in the price given. I think the noise cancellation could have been better.Also if you use continuously battery doesn\\'t last more than 4 hours. At times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. Did not help in long travelling hours. Keep a wired headphones with you if don\\'t want to be bored when the battery goes off.\\n\",3\\n\"I am using this for last two months. Over all performance is very good.

The control buttons in right side.\\n\",3\\n\"After 45 days my Earphones are stopped working.. I tried to cliam my warranty but it boat team is not responding. I have registered my Earphones till now I have not received any confirmation email from them.. Worst experience from boat team.. Don\\'t buy this product...\\n\",1\\n\"Beat BT earphones go for it best sound and best noise cancellation. Good for students and music wow. Great battery life upto 7 hrs with 75% volume. Good remote control can take calls and and change the tracks. Good for calling also. Good mic I love it.\\n\",5\\n\"Ok guysSound is 3 out of 5 only bass no serious good soundSound is not very high for pubgThe biggest problem is that i ise iphone and it beeps very much while increasing or decreasing volume, changing song playing paise even while dragging it , it feels very bad and it is very annoying . My honest advice is that it should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been not priced for more than 1000 rupees\\n\",2\\n\"In 1000rs sound quality is very good. Bass in this price is very good.Pro-Sound qualityBass(sometime over)Price(1000rs in sale)Battery backupCon-Build quality is not that good, it is ok.Microphone quality is not that much good.Very good for base lovers.Over all its a good deal if you buy this in 1000rs\\n\",4\\n\"I bought this product for Rs.1000 from Amazon as it was on an offer. I must say it\\'s such a wonderful product at this price. It\\'s been more than 1 month now and I am using it for more than 3 hours everyday and no issues as of now. Great sound quality, good battery life, great product at this value.\\n\",4\\n\"The product is highly light weight, suitable for joggers & gymnasium freaks. Also since it is Sweat proof & water proof makes it highly compatible with the above mentioned users. The bass is terrific. The noise cancellation is up to the mark. Supports Google Assistant with a one second press of the power key.Got it for 1499 just a little over 24 hours of order.\\'v\\'\\n\",4\\n\"Overall its a good headset.. but it have some major drawbacks.. as a music lover i felt that the bass is good enough but the other things are a bit low. and while playing pubg and using voice chat it automatically reduces the surrounding sounds and i can\\'t hear footsteps and gunshots clearly.. so i think these two are a major problem.\\n\",3\\n\"I got this earphone for 949 RS. It is worth for price. Sound quality is very good and bass is also very much high. And design and color is also very attractive. it is little bit uncomfortable for running. Because of very long size its bounced while running.Good for gym and crossfit workout. You can buy upto 1299 RS.\\n\",5\\n\"Too much bass effecting the sound quality. Mid and treble are nowhere balancesand has to use equilizer. Not recommended if you want to listen old Hindi songs else good for current remixes trend.\\n\",4\\n\"Bluetooth connectivity is not as expected.Brought for 990rs and now it\\'s for 2k that\\'s way too much. People are not fool, if they have 2k budget then they\\'ll go for jbl wireless earphone for 2000 rs instead.I believe review should be with respect to current price only which is 2k...\\n\",1\\n\"The length of the wire is too long and it\\'s quite inconvenient while it\\'s not plugged into the ears! And there is no return.yiu have to live with what you have got.thwre is only replacement with the same model of same brand allowed.thats unfortunate.Iam totally disappointed.how can I predict the feel of the wire length before ordering and tried testing it once?!\\n\",1\\n\"Got this product from amazon but replacing it with 24hrs as bluetooth stop working..I had to keep my phone about half hand distance for Bluetooth to connect.. Sound quality and look n feel is awesome..hoping to get a replacement with a defect free product. Got a replaced one and returing that eithin 10 days as bluetooth stoped working\\n\",1\\n\"Its pretty decent wireless earpiece at this price range , brought it for 999 rs1.Sound quality is good at first but now its become avarage ,2. Bass is good3. Battery backup is also good at first its runs around 6-7 hours but now 4-5 hours5. True sweat proofing , even i have used it under heavy rain but its work fine till now6. Avarege build quality\\n\",4\\n\"Bought these at 999/- . Decent sound and good quality. But sometime I face too much of interference while driving, couldn\\'t know the exact reason. Anyway I suggest to buy if you are looking for some midrange headset.\\n\",4\\n\"Good sound Quality product for this price. Battery is good as it comes for 6hrs of usage. My only concern is mic quality is not as expected as more surrounding noise is captured when speaking. Other than this it\\'s money worthy.\\n\",5\\n\"One of the best budget Bluetooth headset. It has a decent amount of bass, a bit lacking in volume. The passive noise cancellation is great. The product is definitely worth it\\'s price. The delivery was fast too.\\n\",4\\n\"Though the sound and battery life is worth buying this product, in one months time the left earplug stopped working without any reason. There was no rough handling neither any connection to water, while listening to the music I realized that there is no sound from left speaker and I dont know what to do or where to go for servicing/checking. So guys, if you wish to buy, rethink and then spend.\\n\",2\\n\"Wanna tell u when I bought it for first time. It was the best then any of the headset I have ever used. And after that I ordered two more. But they where the fake or was not that good. Sound was too bad and the Bluetooth chip set was different from the first I ordered. I can say they where not original. So I replaced them and again I got the fake one so I finally returned them.\\n\",5\\n\"Not for heavy bass heads, but yes a decent sound delivery......Battery life could have been a lil better however its not that badDurability is something that i just love this device for.......Kudos to boat team, i won\\'t comment on sound quality but again the sturdy hulk alike built quality durability at its best.Over all a great product ..... \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x89 \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\n\",4\\n\"The product is good in terms of music quality, base, treble everything is sorted but a huge drawback isTHAT THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CALL WILL HERE ALL THE SURROUNDING VOICES CLEARLY & TOO LOUDLY EXCEPT YOUR OWN VOICE.\\n\",3\\n\"It is the best earphones I ever saw. It\\'s sound quality is best with a very good bass, It is comfortable to use u can easily wear it for 5-6 hours, it\\'s battery backup is really good u can use it for whole day in one charge, when u wear it , it cancelles the outer sound u just hear it\\'s sound .

Overall product is Good.\\n\",4\\n\"In price point of view its goood, sound quality is not up to tha mark,, average mic quality, battery backup 5 hours continuous user, for moderate use it comes 3 days for me,, charging time 2.30 hours to full.\\n\",3\\n\"Overall build quality is good. Quality of sound is also good compared to the price. However not at all happy with the blue tooth connectivity when connected to phone. Audio as well as connectivity creates donations. Very often get complains from the other side as I\\'m not audible.\\n\",3\\n\"When you buy this Bluetooth earphones, Amazon/ Boat says 6 hours battery backup but its not true only 2-3 hours battery life, cause i calculated 2-3 times, I\\'m live in Mumbai, i was travel in Mumbai local trains daily 1\\xc2\\xbd hours to destination but when i was coming my home i daily charge, i just use when i was Traveling only.... But as per comparisons Sound quality Boat 220 is always best...\\n\",3\\n\"Bluetooth connectivity 5 out 5SOUNDS quality;Vocals 4 out 5Bass  5 out 5Instruments sounds 5 out 5Battery;Battery stand by time awesome more than 1 weekBattery Performance 5 hr to 8hrCharging time 2hrBuild quality is excellent and waterproofWorth of buying product 4.5 out 5\\n\",5\\n\"Not the best from boat. The headset discharges pretty quick. Otherwise it has good sound quality, and is ideal for work outs.\\n\",3\\n\"The product is super.Comes with hard bass.Treble is also good. Good for workout as it doesn\\'t get off your ears easily,the magnet gets seperated sometime while running but thats fine though.total value for purchase.\\n\",5\\n\"Good product but not comfortable in ear it make some disturbing sound when listening at low volume I am not sure why this is happening may be it is there will all wireless earphones which make unclear sound. Battery is good but after reaching 60 percentage it fall very quickly.bass is superb best bass earphones.\\n\",4\\n\"After 6month of usage one of the side not working, when checked on website this is common problem and worst part customer service is not good they do not pick call. It\\'s better not to buy-people can save their precious time.\\n\",1\\n\"After using for 2 days when the battery got fully drained i kept it on chargin.Now it doesnt turns on after chargin is disconnected.but it turns  on and off while connected to charging.Bad piece of hardware which couldnt stand for even 2 days.Not a good experience for sure.If others are facing the same donot buy!\\n\",1\\n\"Overall bass and the sound clarity is best in budget but after i I used it for a month the button automatically gets pressed and the tune gets changed and also volume goes down automatically without pressing anything.I have got replacement warranty so I will change it but they have only one store at Mumbai they should extend their branches.Hope u will get some info from this review.\\n\",3\\n\"This is the worst product which I purchased it was not working and wasn\\'t connecting to any device bcoz red and blue both light used to blink.. I raised a complaint and they took for replacement and said replacement done and sent the same product by doing neat polish .after replacement also not working trying to reach boad customer care but no response.. don\\'t by this product..\\n\",1\\n\"I bought the product as the reviews were good. I even liked it as it is a descent one. It was the price point I thought was little higher Rs 1699 but then I thought that it being a Branded product hence the price could be high.What I am regretting right now is that I bought it at 1699 and within 2 weeks the price has dropped to 999.I feel like betrayed.\\n\",1\\n\"Pros1. looks stylish2.Great sound quality3. Good Battery4.Ergonomic design.Cons1.irritating announcement every time you connect/disconnect or Power on/off the device a small beep would have been fine for me.2.not exactly a con but latency is a little high so if you are thinking to play games while wearing this be prepared for the lag.\\n\",4\\n\"\\xc2\\xa0Value for money.Sufficient battery backup for a day.However, the wireless  range is comparatively very short.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is good , battery life is bakwas , overall you are always thinking about the battery and enjoy the music less . Buy some product which has more battery backup\\n\",3\\n\"I bought this item on 18th February 2019 from India but within 2 months it got damaged by not working right side earphone. Now i suggest you to not but this item as it is no trustable for me. And I do not know how to back it as I am in foreign right now\\n\",1\\n\"AMAZON IS USELESS, KNOW I PURCHASE FROM FLIPKART, THEY ARE MORE BETTER IN THIS REGARD,  THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING I NEED A REPLACEMENT, I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND IT WORKED FOR ONLY TWO DAYS, I SENT FOR WARRANTY AND THEY REPLACED ME WITH OTHER USED EARPHONE , BUT AGAIN THE EARPHONE IS NOT CHARGING ,REALLY USELESS PRODUCT, A\\n\",1\\n\"The sound quality is acceptable from such a cheap pair but there is no proper noise cancellation. But the worst part is that the left earpiece has completely stopped working within 3 months!!Theres 1 year warranty but no one responded to my request.Dont waste money on it.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality not as expected. Used boat wired ear phones earlier. Compared to that it is not effective. Old piece having issue with left side after using 1 year. But I preferred boat again because of quality,but disappointed with wireless piece.\\n\",4\\n\"This earphones is worst thing you can get.It just works awesome for few days but after a month my earphone\\'s right speaker are not working...Not worth of money..And customer service is also worse. They will not care about you.Please don\\'t buy it.\\n\",1\\n\"Superb bass probably the best in this price range.Battery life is ok last up to 4 he\\'s on full charge. Got them @999 at this price it is a steal deal.Thank u Amazon. These earphones or way better than jbl.\\n\",5\\n\"Till date best headphones I had. It is nice product, however few time I do face disturbance while I\\'m listening to music. Also there is no indicator for Low Battery warning. All of sudden a voice comes which says oops battery low n the Bluetooth is switched off. Rest all is awesome.\\n\",4\\n\"Just go for it with no second thought since it has good bass and sound quality for attending calls is awesome without any noise and didn\\'t feel bad at all after purchasing this product and it is worthy for your money.\\n\",5\\n\"Hi guys.. i baught this product at a time of amazon sale. So i got a good deal of INR 1499/- in this price its very good product if you are looking for bluetooth handsfree. Connectivity & battery life is very good. But sound quality is not that much good.  Overall its a good and decent product.. nthng spl as much.\\n\",3\\n\"Person on the other side of the phone hears a lot of surrounding noise when i use this earphone for calling...And I have confirmed this issue from many of my friends who are also using this earphone...They all are facing this issue...And it is really irritating for the person on the other side..Rest are good.. Battery is huge..12 hours max on moderate use..Sound quality is okay\\n\",3\\n\"Noice cancellation is not there. On call only background sound is hearing and not the persons voice. So much of distortion in voice to the opponent on call. And treble is more than base. Treble and base balance is not there. I brought it with full expectations to gift it but disappointed very badly. You can not make phone call if you are in outside. Worst product seriously. : (\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is basic ... too basic. It cannot give the output that you would expect from boat. For music wit low volume is good. Cannot give output anywhere close to apple headsets\\n\",3\\n\"Bought it in sale for \\xe2\\x82\\xb91099. Much more worth than its price. The bass is real good and so is the battery life.. it charges too quickly and it connects fast too.. It can connect two devices simultaneously and its a great deal for such minimal price.. Also the delivery happened within one day so yeah a review from a happy customer\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\n\",5\\n\"A compact product by boat at this cool price point, such a good product for bass lover. Fitting is good, noise cancellation is best looking at the price, bass is awesome.Cons are bit lengthy, low and mid tunes are not clear sometimes.Overall is a highly recommend product to all budget bass and music lover.\\n\",5\\n\"No Battery back up even after full charging. No light indicator for full charge or no charge. It\\'s working only if the device is connected to a charging port. No proper return policy. There is no option to replace the item with another brand, so i am forced to return it and compromise with the same brand which is no near my expectation. Go for a better brand.\\n\",1\\n\"Very good sound quality, battery life and Bass\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8cBut when We will keep in pocket getting some distribution and not connecting properly, voice or song fluctuating. otherwise good\\n\",5\\n\"In this headphone, you will hardly find any loopholes. But while talking over the call on WhatsApp or on other platforms, this headphone doesn\\'t allow Noise Cancellation of surroundings. Here, it takes back its seat from being perfect.\\n\",4\\n\"Awessome!!Good sound than expected.. Good noise cancellation...  Comfort in ear and mic is also good for calls...Worth for price below 2k..

I would like to suggest you not to purchase this product.\\n\",1\\n\"The headset range and the battery backup is good. Superb bass but sound quality is poor for treble. Lack of sound clearance and the MIC is not clear to the receivers end during phone call.\\n\",4\\n\"Lemme come directly to negative issues here :Bluetooth connectivity - sometimes it just won\\'t connect with my phone, or takes too much time.Intermittent audio loss: while playing the earphones mutes itself automatically, It happens quite often and it\\'s very annoying. Same issue after replacement. So I had to return it.\\n\",3\\n\"The bass is ok and the treble and highs are not so good enough it\\'s not good for vocals. It can get pretty loud tho...! I have also experience while kept in my pocket the audio gets cut no often but sometimes but its good for calling And I also experience one problem with this that while playing PUBG the mic was not working at all that was weird i try alot of thing but it didn\\'t activated it\\'s mic ;-(\\n\",2\\n\"The product is good with great bass the only problem is when we call someone the voice breaks & and battery drops from 20% to direct zero.One star less because of that other wise good product\\n\",4\\n\"Used it for hardly 5 months during my workout session, it stopped working suddenly with a real paining sound, they clearly mentioned that it is meant for intense workout, but it is actually not even sweat resistant which leads to the internal short circuit, not even the led is not glowing.\\n\",2\\n\"Everything is good but durability sucks and that means the product is really waste.I have it since 2 months and one on side has already stopped working.I wouldn\\'t  buy it again and you shouldn\\'t buy it now\\n\",1\\n\"It was not working properly.

With 60%-70% volume, it hardly works for 3 hours, this is very bad considering the brand.\\n\",1\\n\"This is a stupid product, I feel they have cheated by sending fake copy product, it worked only for 2 weeks, and now the sound is unclear and very low, I\\'m unable replace now, service centre is in Mumbai, how can I go from chennai to Mumbai?? Instead buy some good brand like Samsung level u, amazon pls tell how to use the warranty and repair or replace it\\n\",1\\n\"Not a good earphone at all. Waste of money....

I din like the overall sound signature.Bass is okayish din have the thump as described in many reviews, the overall loudness is also low.I\\'ve used them in POCO F1 and Redmi note 7pro.Finally returned the product. as its not the value for money product.\\n\",2\\n\"I cannot give a genuine feedback on sound quality, noise cancellation  and all , because , I order this for 1399 , and I received a package with additional buds , a USB connector and catalogues.  This package did not have an earphone in it . So disappointing  . I don\\'t know if it\\'s with the seller or manufacturer, it is so strange to see an empty package from Amazon\\n\",1\\n\"Received Headset today. Will point Cons directly :1. Design is Not ergonomic & will not feel comfortable.2. Noise cancellation is very poor. Except your voice all are clear while call.3. Sound quality is OK only. Lot of Bass is there, if you like it.4.

Especially when the. Attery is low. It yells, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oops! Batter low\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in my ear after every minute. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extremely irritating.

Otherwise its a must buy...!\\n\",5\\n\"Absolutely awesome earphones if u are tired of those wired kind of thing going just down there and annoying go wireless also the massive noise cancellation is very good with one charge it works on 5-6 hours of playback.it gives voice commands on this whether u are connected to the earphones or not.\\n\",5\\n\"I\\'ve been using the product once in a while when I go out to jog and every it does a good job at holding in my ears and providing an acceptable quality of sound and novel sound cancellation with no issues of sweatBut none of that feels perfect but just enough to bear with it for a couple of hoursIt\\'s a good \"\"product for the price\"\"\\n\",3\\n\"Very good. Bass is on the higher side. But I enjoy high bass. Very good for songs. Noise cancellation is wonderful. Call quality is also good.\\n\",5\\n\"The product is good with its sound quality and battery. But i doubt its durability as its very light and thin. Not worth to buy for 2500/- as I got it in 1000/- in amazon deal and hence no regret.\\n\",5\\n\"For me, this earphone is working like so far so good because I\\'m using it from just a month. Actual review will come after 5-6 months of usage.\\n\",5\\n\"Product is very good but given charging cable is defective so using mobile charging cable, Bluetooth connectivity is good but anything like your hand comes between headphone and mobile, you may feel some disturbance in connection\\n\",5\\n\"At this price range sound quality must be improved... Rest it\\'s definitely a option for budget Bluetooth earphone\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality is good,noise cancellation works perfectly. Bluetooth connection works fine, the wires could have been a little shorter. Battery also works fine, the only thing is when indicator is shown for low battery (20%) it drains within minutes.\\n\",4\\n\"i\\'m happy with the product good sound quality and battery life but mike is not that good... i am using it on my gym and its comfortable..\\n\",4\\n\"Very bad and dissatisfying service. its one side is not working after 3months of my purchase, I complained but no Response from Boat and there courier partner is completely irresponsible. Will never purchase from BOAT again.\\n\",1\\n\"Awesome earphones in this price segment1)First of all I will talk about the baseThe base is really awesome that can give u the beats of each songs2)second  I liked the noise cancellation it\\'s really awesome even while sitting in train u cants feel the noise passing the train besides youoverall I love the product\\n\",5\\n\"Headphone is great so far but only downside is am not able control call with this, if I increase its volume during it gets increased but when I try lower down the volume I didnt find any way in both ways increase or decrease volume only increases also after 30 percent of volume it starts prompting volume down volume down\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality for music is good but not at all good for voice calls. The mic pics alot of surrounding noise. There is no noise cancellation for mic. Build quality is also bad. The clip that fits in the ear comes out and moves in the groove. This happened after only after a month.\\n\",3\\n\"the best wireless bluetooth headset under 3k boAt rockerz but i\\'ve got it for 999 and this is a best headset under this price tag ..... sound quality is owsome .. not any type of pain in ear very crystal clear sound i love it ... if any one wants a bluetooth headset just go for it ... and don\\'t think about any negative comnt .... i can say that boAt rockxxx...\\n\",5\\n\"Ah the thing is, i bought this earphones for morning running but you still need to develop it. It fits good when you are walking but while running mostly it doesnt keep balance and fell off. Do more design like samsung level U earphones where weight is added so they wont fell off and some need some fitting arangement in shape to fit properly in ear.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality is very good for the headphone, but when it comes to the quality of voice while on call, its definitely a failure for this BOAT Rockerz 255. The other person on the call is not at all able to hear my voice. Very much disappointed !!!\\n\",2\\n\"Product quality good. Packing good. But sound clarity average. Pairing and on/off all in one button, so little different to use, specifically for a non tec savvy person.Battery life good. Charging time, average.\\n\",4\\n\"excellent battry life quality is also good but sound is fine not very good as i expected from boat but good..i got it \\xe2\\x82\\xb91099 excellent !! else it is wroth of 2500\\xe2\\x82\\xb9 but everything is fine i suggesting every one can buy this\\n\",5\\n\"I have used this headphone just a week and right side earphone is not working at allReally very disappointed with this\\n\",1\\n\"Usually it is one of best budget Bluetooth headphones with great sound quality and bass and noise cancellation is great .But build quality is not that great . After using it for a month the right earbud stopped working . I was totally satisfied with this product but after this incident now i know that the build quality of the product is very poor.\\n\",3\\n\"I go to gym wearing these earphones. Sound quality is good and they didn\\'t stop working after a rough use in gym. Sweat and weight, they have gone through it all and still working. Adding this review after two months of use.\\n\",5\\n\"If you want to purchase best headphone under 1500Rs so it is a best product. Sound quality is so good but but wire is long so when i running on the track then it create a problem but another quality is so good............\\n\",4\\n\"Worst product, it been just 15 days and one side is NOT working even though I took very much care on not to overcharge,  not to expose to heat/moisture,  neither did pulled it much.With these super optimal condition if the product fails functioning,  we should think of its quality.I am trying to claim warranty/replacement.\\n\",1\\n\"Was interested because I bought their sound bar which was sensational. However, I\\'m quite disappointed with the sound quality. It lacks bass.That being said, if my expectations weren\\'t that high based on my previous experience, it would be a decent choice.\\n\",4\\n\"Worthless product, don\\'t buy this.. The sound is not that great but more importantly it stopped working for me within a month.. There are much better option like QY7 that have much better sound and durability.\\n\",1\\n\"Build quality is awesomeVery light to handle.Battery backup is good last for 5 hours on single charge.Can keep volume to 30% is well and good enough to hear clearly.Ear bud are good and able to easily fit in ears.There is magnetic lock but it doesn\\'t have any function this is only con of this product\\n\",5\\n\"It has decent sound quality and battery life, the product feels delicate but no problems so far. This product is a good buy for the price\\n\",5\\n\"Bought these on 4th of February, and I am writing this review on 3rd of March. The Bluetooth connectivity is dead and is not getting connected at all. Even if it gets connected the connection is lost after keeping my phone in pocket.Really not satisfied with the product. This was my fourth boat product and services are worse than their products\\n\",1\\n\"It just 3 months and it stops working. One side speaker stopped working in less the 2 months and note if is not at all working. Trying to get replacement online from boat rockerz website but not accepting\\n\",1\\n\"We should speak louder whenever roaming in streets... Call Receiving person cannot hear my voice clearly even am walking... But quality and bass is mass. One day it slipped from my hear while am driving. Then it was hitted by auto. Then I took it again using it.. Still the quality of sound not changed.\\n\",4\\n\"I used for 7 days then returned because its not works more than 3+ meter distance. I bought replacement also but found same quality.\\n\",1\\n\"Boat - Battery charge doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay longer if you are on it the entire day .. I have used better products though their or on the higher price range ..

Mine got malfunctioned on 11th day of purchase... BOAT claims they\\'ll take 10-12 days to provide you with a replacement or repaired piece, but it will easily take around 23-25 days.Not much happy with the product.If you are investing arnd 1.5k in this, please look for another options.\\n\",1\\n\"I got the product yesterday, and the battery was fully charged & on continoluous listening it lasted for 2hours which was still ok, but now when I kept it for charging for almost an hour, it is not getting charged.\\n\",1\\n\"I ordered 5 Bluetooth earphone headsetsAmong them all I kept only this oneSound quality and bass owsomeQuality material used is very goodFits on ear very nicely\\n\",5\\n\"Very good sound clarity with bass. The neck band is very flexible. You do not have to worry about handling. It looks like it would withstand rough use to a good extent. Overall a very good basic product. I have used many other boAt wired and wireless earphones. This is not a long term review of the product though.\\n\",5\\n\"I bought the product during Amazon sale  the product is good. It\\'s durable the sound quality is also good , if you are  serious sound/music lover then you can check other options but personally this is all I wanted for my workout.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality is good, the highs and lows are well balanced, but when it comes to the bass its a bit less.The range of the bluetooth is very low, it works well if you are in the same room, but as soon as you move towards the next room it gets disconnected.\\n\",3\\n\"This headphone is a good quality headphone and it\\'s Bass is also good. Wires connnected to the speakers are thin and could be little thicker.\\n\",4\\n\"Value for money product. Before purchasing this item, I used to think that Bluetooth earphones are not good. But this earphone change my mind. The design and sound quality of this headset is awesome. And battery life is also good. If you need such device, then go for it. I purchased it for \\xe2\\x82\\xb91400, but can get it at 1000 in Sale.\\n\",5\\n\"I purchased this on 23rd Jan19 and was fully satisfied by this product. However since 14th Feb, some weird sounds started to come during call. It\\'s irritating and can not do anything. Replacement days are gone and dont know what to do. I should have gone for JBL paying small difference. Its on luck i guess......\\n\",4\\n\"Everything is really good at such price range Cons:1. Battery indication is not perfect. Its shows level of 100,80,60,20. So before you know, you might run out of battery.2. Sound reception of mouth piece is not perfect. Surrounding noise is heard more prominantly at far end rather than speaker\\'s voice\\n\",4\\n\"Its been a month now... First of all its a neckband wireless in the ear headphone.. The sound is more like boat basshead 255..i have used 255 earlier.. Battery backup is probably 5-6 hours.. i got it in sale at 990.. And at this cost Its worth it...\\n\",4\\n\"Thanks amazon to fulifll my cartIts a very good Bluetooth headphonesGo guys n buy..you will never regretI bought in amazon sale with 10 percent cashback 900 rs\\n\",5\\n\"Mat start for 2 months, it worked with high quality of sound , then my right side sound one day suddenly went off...I can negligibly hear any sound . This was followed by left earpiece. Now I can hear more surround noise then the sound of music  or video. To note it\\'s only been  3 months since I have purchased.\\n\",2\\n\"best budget wireless earphones. bass heavy (as expected from boat) above average clarity. mic is also average. getting a little over 5 hours of battery life with constant usage. hate the fact that for the last 10-15% it keeps on saying low battery every couple of minutes.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound is like good but its not good as we are expecting from the Company name - BOAT !Yup It work fine with my OnePlus 6 .Bluetooth range is fine with my handset but it is not good with redmi note 4 ,5 and 6 . It will show some lag when your handset is in your jeans pocket.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is good but the volume compared to the boat rockerz450 is way better.. Since its a in -ear headphone boad could have worked on it a little more.. The bass and great.. There is no screachy sound while listening to music,  video or any vocal sound..Battery is good..Good quality product.\\n\",4\\n\"This is very simple earphones. No stereo sounds no Eco sound no deep base bass as well as not much more Cristal sound. If this earphones rate has 500rs then it will be good. Rate is very high not performance according to price. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recommend for any one but this product is Normal pls do not exite for this.\\n\",3\\n\"This is my 5th boat\\'s product in last 3 years ...i trust this company\\'s products blindly.. this earphones is value for money.. very light weight .. sound quality is awesome... Purchase it without wasting time ur time in reading reviews .. go for it ..Sound quality is no doubt best in this segment...\\n\",5\\n\"Calls have disturbance and sometimes not. Not sure why. However, I am keeping it to use for music only. If you are buying for calls then buy something else.\\n\",3\\n\"It\\'s really good...Clear sound and some extra bass..It\\'s good think that when you listen old songs that time you feel little bit of bass of old songs...This product I\\'ve use on Mi device it\\'s good...But others handset\\'s have not to good sound..If u change sound effect then you satisfy.Thank you..\\n\",4\\n\"What an item it is!! Must say, the sound quality, the design, specially the bass effect is just perfect. While the songs are played, you just loose yourself in the mood and the sound quality makes you feel that it is real. Completely happy purchasing the product. Please purchase if would like to.\\n\",5\\n\"Honestly speaking sound quality is not as expected, bass is good but rest all not so great,Battery is not bad I get 6-7 hoursDurability is good,Connectivity is not good, regular disconnection happens while you move few meters or while traveling which is not expected.Overall I would rate this below 4\\n\",4\\n\"OMG\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8dIt\\'s an amazing product in this price range. Battery life is very good. Sound quality superb. Facing difficulty in fixing in my ear but i can say it\\'s a great product for purchasing. Arrived early. Love the product. Will buy again.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality so good at this price range (1499)But i have some problems,the bt range was good,but some time i hold my phone few feet from bt ep.there is a sound or connection drop for 1 sec.I don\\'t know the reason.maybe my products falut but i dont retrun this because it is a minar issue\\n\",4\\n\"Good earphone for sound quality but there is Bluetooth range problem , in specifications boat says 10m range but actually this earphone has range upto only 3m, when battery is below 50% it\\'s Bluetooth range is only 1m, Also battery backup is very poor\\n\",2\\n\"Okay I am using this product for 1 day or so and here are some of my thoughts :Pros :1. Cheap2. Good Bass3. Nice call quality4. Good battery lifeCons :1. Sound is a bit shrill2. Bluetooth range is very less3. Not suitable for gaming purposes\\n\",5\\n\"To me this headset is worthless. Simple reason that the basic noise cancellation is absent and one can\\'t use these to talk. The other person would complain or hear more of background noise than my own. If a product ignores such a basic feature means its not worth a penny\\n\",1\\n\"This one is the best bluetooth earphones you can get at this price range. However I\\'m disappointed that it states on website as dual pairing but it does not. Can someone from boat check the same.\\n\",4\\n\"Its a awsm product, fr loud music lover. Packng ws a litng bit bended bt d product was in gd condition... Looks was good... This headph is hlpfull fr gymng n running... Overall, will give 4.5 starts...\\n\",5\\n\"I bought these about 15 days back. The sound quality isn\\'t all that great, great bass and average noise cancellation. The durability is the part that sucks the most, the battery gave up on me after being to the gym for just 7 to 8 times, which is disappointing. I had high hopes from this purchase but sadly, boAt let me down with this.\\n\",3\\n\"Well excellent sound quality and provides good noise cancellation .. but when the controller catches the sweat the buttons do not function properly.It\\'s just a month and this has happened twice now so if these people are mentioning that sport earphones they pls don\\'t fall for that.. its just useful for normal and just be thoughtful.\\n\",2\\n\"Product is ok. Sound mids and lows are ok. Sound gets diatracts if u increase volume above 70% . I found geekcases Status bluetooth headsets better than this bcoz it has Aptx sound technology in it which boat rockerz does not have.\\n\",3\\n\"T\\'he product is not as per my expectations, it got disconnect automatically in between (though it has enough battery life) and you have to establish the connection again. Sometimes it work and sometimes it don\\'t.  In just 38 days the the product  has lost its life and now is completely dead.\\n\",1\\n\"Worst product ever by boat i was a big fan of boat products i own boat rugby boat stone 600 boat rockerz headphones every products are best but these boat rockers 255 is the worst product i firstly thought that there might be some problem so I replaced with new one then also same issues i was suffering that\\'s why I requested refund\\n\",1\\n\"It\\'s uncomfortable for ear\\'s .Sounds is amazing but i have returned this product because it\\'s fitting was not proper in my right ear .Otherwise it\\'s good .Wire length was disappointed me.It\\'s too long so looks very bad .So i returned this product and i have purchased mi sports basic Bluetooth earphone.\\n\",2\\n\"I got it @ \\xe2\\x82\\xb9 1999 and after one month of use I can say it\\'s an ok type product.Worth for moneySound quality is good, but cannot be compared with what JBL provides.\\n\",4\\n\"Not so good noice cancellation. Baas is too loud, little uneasy, i would still give 4 our of 5.\\n\",4\\n\"Not good sound quality and disconnects many a times. Also it shows 60% battery remaining and after 5min i get to hear \"\"oops battery down\"\".Not good for xiomi phones.\\n\",1\\n\"After four month both side of speaker not working and i am cmplaining from last 5 days on call and also register complain but they are not replying....worst product....dont buy....\\n\",1\\n\"I really like this set. It\\'s better than the one I got from the US. The drivers in this one are very good. I recommend this set.\\n\",5\\n\"This is a 5 star product but unfortunately had very bad experience in service ,it\\'s not been even 6 months my oneside earpiece stopped and I tried to complain they rejected it saying wrong bill , as I have purchased it from amazon.in I attached the bill screenshots and the company rejected. Overall best product as per performance.\\n\",1\\n\"Today I receive this product , sound quality is ok , but its Bluetooth range is so poor . Poor means its worst. Worst product ever. I m surprise that how this product is in amazon\\'s choice list.\\n\",1\\n\"To say truth,sound quality is really awesome as expected. Clear and Cristal sound. Bass is superb.Coming to battery life,batttery life is also great once full charge not to worry for entire whole day. Regards to durability, I have not used for so long, so no idea. But the built quality really good so can be durable for long time.\\n\",5\\n\"Good product, there is no issues with noise cancellation, sound quality is very much with bass and surrounding system,Thanks to Boat and Amazon\\n\",5\\n\"Great sound, awesome bass.... Only issue i found is tht the wire is too long, it\\'s hard to carry it around... I was using philips shb 5250, and this is supposed to be a replacement.. But due to the wire length shifted back to philips... As its a hassle while driving\\n\",5\\n\"Item was defected peice bluetooth was not working.i have tried android mobile and IOsS mobile aswell as laptop not detecting properly. And also battery also not charging.\\n\",1\\n\"Bass is really awesome. Treble is also good. You can listen to all the beats very clearly. Bought it in a deal at only 1000 rs. So totally worth it for me.\\n\",5\\n\"Voice cancellation is jus not available. In six months off light use (twice a week) already one side earphone has got loose connection... Totally a no...\\n\",1\\n\"I found the music quality of these headphones to be pretty substandard. They weren\\'t able to block outside noise and the build was very filmsy.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound Quality is average, Battery last for 4-5 Hours of playback, major drawback is Bluetooth range is as weak as let\\'s say 10Mtr Max Other one is this Bluetooth Headset interfering with my WiFi I changed channel of wifi and everything but couldn\\'t help. While connection with Bluetooth I can\\'t reach even 5Mbps speed of my WiFi.\\n\",2\\n\"I bought them in a lightening deal from Amazon.at1000 bucks they are worthy. Bass is the main highlight of the BT earphones.Battery life is satisfactory, Build quality is sturdy.I am satisfied with the product.\\n\",4\\n\"I was super excited to get these headphones but it stopped working today after almost 6 months. There right ear piece has stopped giving output.Don\\'t waste your money and time on this.\\n\",1\\n\"Works well with my op3t phone. Occasional small amount of disconnect may be because of bluetooth sync issue. works well most of the times.\\n\",5\\n\"During the call, the other side people will not hear you properly you have to lift the mic and hold it till the time you\\'re speaking. also there is no direct contact between PH and headphone so you can\\'t play the FM. Rest is all gud. Sound quality is better.\\n\",5\\n\"I bought this product for using it in Gym, but due sweat it stopped working in 6 months.I called up the customer care and they replaced the product which took almost 20-25 daysThe replaced product also stopped working within 2 months because of same issue.\\n\",1\\n\"Superb Bluetooth earphone at this price..It fits well in to \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x82, good bass and voice.. battery life is also good.. easy to carry also.. one negative point is that it will protruding little bit outside(it\\'s wire) while listening...\\n\",5\\n\"I had a skullcandy head set earlier so this is a step down but i wanted a cheaper option. The sound  is ok. Only issue is the wires are too long for me and it is not very comfortable to wear on cycle or bike.\\n\",3\\n\"Sound quality as expected from boat is awesome. but lower sound then other brand. the biggest problem i am facing with is connecting with dual devices. while connected with a phone and a laptop it takes time to switch from one device to other and you can receive calls while connected to duel devices. rest everything is fine.\\n\",4\\n\"Just a little con in this product and that is it has a few hours of bettery life, which they have already mentioned.Purchased two of them one is in neon green and another one is red in color at same time.Both the shipment were from different vendor &  from different state and received in good state.\\n\",4\\n\"I got it at a for 999 and for this price it is a beast.ProsVery good clarity of sound and bass and treble are also goodBattery life at full volume is approx 5 hoursGood built qualityConnectivity is awesomeMic is decent not goodCons.Bud could become a problem as it is not upto the mark.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality and noise cancellation is good but the product is not durable at all. I have it for around three months and have replaced it twice. And now the third piece is also not working properly. Issue is after playing for some time the voice starts getting delayed. Then I disconnect and connect again.\\n\",1\\n\"Everything is good about it.. guyss just go for it..I just got it in 1099 deal.. thank u amazon.. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8a\\n\",5\\n\"This is nice product. Although audio quality is not that great, but can\\'t expect more in this price range.

Sounds and build quality is good\\n\",4\\n\"Not worth Rs.1699 that I paid. Sound quality is no better than others available at much lower price. Not useful for workout as well as it tends to fall off.\\n\",2\\n\"This is a really great feeling after getting perfect hands-free Bluetooth.

Good Base, Call Quality and device pairing is too good.  If any one is looking for Bluetooth headset with budget then go for this product.Thank to Amazon for quick delivery and thanks to Boat for quality product.\\n\",4\\n\"Got it for 999 and all I could say is best in it\\'s class. Sound quality is good and the bass too. Some people may feel small pain in ear after continues use as in my case but manageable. Battery backup is very good and gets charged rapidly. Overall worth to go without much research\\n\",5\\n\"The boat rocker 255 ear phone sound quality is really good.

Leaving your own voice the mic would catch everything else. So I won\\'t recommend this earphones for taking the calls.

Its seems like the seller send me a dead earphone\\n\",1\\n\"It feels light and comfortable while wearing. Sound quality is ok ok. I use it during workout so that\\'s not much issue for me.

Only one thing how does a battery % of 60 makes it go discharged. Either it shows wrong % of battery indicator or something is wrong with mine Boat.Anyways, I am still delighted to have it.\\n\",5\\n\"Uncomfortable, produces beep on every mobile action which is frustrating. Also, the connection isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very stable.Bass is good but lacks clarity.\\n\",2\\n\"boAt Rockerz 255 bluetooth wireless earphone is simply superb. Quality of sound is awesome with extra deep bass. Noise cancellation and true HD sound. 4-5 hrs battery backup.

Long battery life approx 8 hrs\\n\",5\\n\"It\\'s worth of the price, everything is good. But i am having issue when i connect these to my MI 55 Inch tv, automatically wifi disconnecting everytime. When i am not using earphone with tv it works fine. I think there is a comatibility issue\\n\",4\\n\"Basically I am music lover. Upto my knowledge it\\'s an extra ordinary product. Sound is good.

No need to think\\n\",5\\n\"Worth buying at 13-1400High bassEnough loudness you can expect from a BT earphoneQuality is good and my personal fav is neon color as it gives a more sporty lookComfortable to wear while workout.Light weightOverall rating 8/10.\\n\",5\\n\"Some ppl may think the bass is high but my overall experience with the product is more than i expected. Battery life and the durability is also very much impressive. Similar to Samsung level U but best than that the flexible band is very comfortable. my score 5/5\\n\",5\\n\"Used 2 months for 1-2 hour daily. Battery lasts upto 45-50 minutes only.Worst battery backup.

Even the earphones which I received was a defective.I won\\'t get charged unless the USB cable is pressed hard. It is also making weird sounds during power on and off.\\n\",1\\n\"Good earphones for those who loves bass! But the drawback is that it doesn\\'t have clear clarity of treble. It has less clarity and more bass! And so according to this feature the cost 1,699/- is bit more. But you get a good battery backup and good built quality.\\n\",3\\n\"if you are looking for bass heavy headphones, these are good choice. low end too is crisp overall good for price\\n\",5\\n\"Noice cancellation is very good.Good Battry life. boAT having good sound quality in its every product.

Good water resistance. Mostly use it while cycling. It is sweat proof too. Easy to use. Sticks in ear even while you are running fast and still very comfortable... Thank you boAt...\\n\",5\\n\"It is one of the worst headphones. The day I got the product, one of the earbud was not working. And the Amazon app is not giving the option to return the product. When I went to the Boat store, the staff was not at all helpful, they told me they won\\'t take the product as they don\\'t repair Bluetooth earphones.\\n\",1\\n\"The best part of this product is flexibility and sweat proof ..its have aws base quality  ..its very useful while driving and we need  to talk on call .....but its battery backup is not upto the mark ..but overall it\\'s a nice product with aws quality\\n\",4\\n\"The product is definitely best in class. Although it mentions that the headset is multipoint enabled, it could not connect to my two iPhones at the same time. Returned.\\n\",5\\n\"If u are looking to jog with it plz don\\'t  buy it, other wise it is good for light gymminNice range and the fit is something that I am not used to, over all  good\\n\",4\\n\"All is good.Only major issue I faced is that the Ear supporter Clamp falls every now and then with it the inner ear grip too.Thats causing a great inconvenience and I am sure it will get lost someday.\\n\",3\\n\"I just got the earphone today. Battery is the best part of this earphone. I\\'m using it for past 8 hours and it still going . While in outdoor there is an interruption in the music. Like when nthe wind flow is high. I don\\'t might be with use it will be all good and there won\\'t be any interruption in the music.\\n\",4\\n\"Best cost effective product that provides best sound quality and good features like splash resistance and 6 hrs battery life. The device has good punchy bass. Boat has built the device well but the material is not so premium. This device is best for guys who want to hear music while working out.\\n\",5\\n\"During the very first month the product was performing well sound quality was excellent but after 45 days one of the earpod has low sound quality  now .The bass is not that good .So please if you can allow me to replace the product i will be grateful because its under one year replacement warranty.

And it is not working today. I am jot able to connect it to any of my devices. It was working fine initially. Bit since last few days i am not able to connect it with my phone. I tried with other 4 different phones but i am not able to connect it.\\n\",1\\n\"An awesome product. The day I put it in the ear, I was spellbound. The bass is good, the treble is good and the sound is crisp and clear. I am lucky that I picked it up at Rs.999. Loving it wearing around the neck all the time and I am now 60.\\n\",5\\n\"It is a problem with battery indicator.Battery indicator on mobile shows 100% or 80% only. Even if the battery is 50% or even less it still reflects 80% and so on. So it does not reflect the exact batterylevel.\\n\",3\\n\"I didnt like the product. Noise cancellation is zero.

It does not charge, switch on or pair with any device. While I did not expect top-grade sound/build quality at this price point (and the sound was very average), I had at least expected it to work for more than a month.\\n\",1\\n\"A good purchase for this price. However, the bluetooth range is max upto 7 to 10 metres only. Sound quality is good and is sweatproof to a good extent. Battery life is just okay, not great.

But the battery is okay and should improve on build quality .\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is very good as always Boat have, Super bass with balanced treble. Within this price range no other can beat boat. Go for it.My 1st product has less treble and i replace that product and this is as expected. If you think sound is not upto the mark then replace your product.\\n\",4\\n\"I am happy to review sound quality is very nice but one problem is that you can\\'t hear sound more than 20 minutes because of air bud quality it so bad\\n\",4\\n\"Good quality, good sound, bass is good, good noise isolation, good for during workout, call quality also good.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound quality is nice, but it\\'s built quality is worst, my friend bought this headphone which he have to sent to service center twice, and mine one started showing problem within 1month, the song automatically restarts and it gets changed by it\\'s own.

ONING AND OFFING the Bluetooth earphones....then it will be works..good\\n\",4\\n\"Good enough but sound is low as compared with other.\\n\",4\\n\"For the price point this lives up the expectation but you expect more battery backup from neck band earphones , this gives you roughly 3.5 to 4 hours of usages . Noise cancellation is not effective , people keep on complaining while on call . Build quality is good .\\n\",3\\n\"Very good sound quality, value for money, good base, noise cancellation is also good, built quality is also good\\n\",5\\n\"Sound is good but if you hate bass than this is not right ...

But, bass is poor. And battery lasts 3-4 hours max. Have to charge it daily. So if you want good quality earphone for movies and calls go for it and if you want it for bass and good battery life, don\\'t go for it.\\n\",3\\n\"Dont how does it works with other phones but with honour pro i used to get headache whenever i use it...\\n\",1\\n\"First one i order had connectivity issues so i order a replacement...look at the pictures of replacement product... package looks tampered or used..and the earphones were dirty also\\n\",2\\n\"Best earphone at this price range,truely worth for moneyGood for bass lovers and Edm music playbackI play pubg and lasts almost 6 hrs ahead in continous playbackAnd it has also power saving mode automatically turns off when not in use.\\n\",5\\n\"Very Happy with the product. Sound quality is above average. Battery life is very good. We don\\'t feel like it\\'s present around your neck. Light weight yet durable. Sits comfortable in my ears. Overall satisfied with my new wireless earphones.\\n\",5\\n\"Very bad experience..i had heard good things about boat earphones..about soubd quality and durability..but my new earphones wont even start..i have not used it even for a day..it turns on only when its on charge..otherwise it wont even start after charging for a whole day..i want my money\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is best in this price range and Bluetooth connectivity is surprisingly good only problem is battery life it is kinda low means you can easily get, 5 hours of usage in one charge but that\\'s not enough anyways I guess that what you get in this price range.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is fare with its price.Bluetooth earphone from boat at this cheap price it\\'s unexpected.if you want this for music then it\\'s OK.But when watching movie or some lectures then it\\'s sound is low.Overall this earphone is good. Overall rating is 4/5\\n\",5\\n\"Very good Bluetooth earphones with excellent sound and built quality. Battery life is also good. One thing to notice is that the wire is bit long to my liking. Totally satisfied with my purchase.\\n\",5\\n\"Not satisfied with the product. Sound quality is not at all good. I bought these because these were in my budget. Go for a better brand if you want to have a long term durability. Or, buy it at discount. I don\\'t feel they are worth it for Rs.1500\\n\",3\\n\"Durability is really good, flexible and doesn\\'t fall off ears that easy, although the rubber material used for the eargrip isn\\'t that great and is the only con (for which I have given a star less). Also for the price it\\'s available, one can\\'t really complain about battery. Which is 6hrs.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality bass good but one side stopped working sound is getting lower day by day no service station number is working as they shows on you tube or warrany card..verybad boat befooling indian people\\n\",1\\n\"Nice fit and finish. Quick pairing with phone. The range is about 10ft max, but works well. Haven\\'t used much to comment on battery life. Sound is good if you are into bass, I prefer neutral sound image.\\n\",5\\n\"So I like everything about this bluetooth. It\\'s battery life, sound, range of connectivity. But when I talk to people on call they could hear the voice of my surrounding clearly but couldn\\'t hear my voice. So basically even if it says notice cancellation but it doesn\\'t work.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought these earphones in the third week of January 2019. They worked great for more than 5 months and now they have stopped working from 1st July, 2019. I was just listening to songs and a weird sound \\'chhuchik\\' came from right earphone and it is not turning on from then.\\n\",3\\n\"Ok.. in that price... Not much battery backup .For me feels like the ear things not fit so fine.. I have to get used to of it.. it\\'s not quite comfortable.\\n\",3\\n\"Nice product, bought Boult wireless earphones but returned them because of bettary issue ... Boat ride up again in my view... These are best in this price.. nice ,bettary backup up good, material is soft smooth nice bass\\n\",5\\n\"Product is not as I expected. When I brought the first one the sound was distorted at times so replaced it with another one still its the same issue.\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality is great.sound clearity cristal clear. Bluetooth range is unbelievable. It works even room is closed.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is good phone reception quality is also good but am unable to play pubg using this because of it take 2sec time to receive sound from mobile while playing pubg\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality very good. Battery life could be better to make it perfect. Also the length of wire could be reduced/adjustable. Currently too long\\n\",4\\n\"Please do not buy it .... I bought and the problem started after 15 days .. Battery is weak .. adjustable buttons skips the song on its own after playing it for 15 seconds ... You can get  repair only through official site .. they repaired it thrice still problem continues such a waste\\n\",1\\n\"Worst earphones ever. The funny part is whenever you try to listen a music of good quality with awesome bass the intention of these heaadpones is the make that music unbearable. I wish the brand would have endorsed in technology and quality rather then marketing and actors endorsement.\\n\",2\\n\"Sound should be louder with bass. Clarity is good but what I thought this product is not louder (fadu)\\n\",3\\n\"Carry case was not included in the package.. however, the sound quality is very good with a strong bass. Battery charging takes unusually long time. Overall, satisfied with the product.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality Awesome, Battery life is very good but auto connection problem we have to connect manually otherwise no problem at all.  If you want to buy then you can buy it.\\n\",4\\n\"In love with boat speakers they are a steal in this price range awesome bass and sounds. I use it 3 days without charge do I have to say more .\\n\",5\\n\"My review after using it for 15 days , the product is worth for the money compared to other brands like JBL , Sony etc .1) Good HD sound quality2) awesome bass3) battery backup is just fine gives 6hrs  playbackOverall satisfied..would like to give 4 stars\\n\",4\\n\"Excellent Battery backup - lasts around entire day for general, non continuous use.Good sound quality...\\n\",5\\n\"The sound quality is just wow. It stays in ear preety well. I didn\\'t notice any falling off from ear during running. It has flat cable ,but built quality of the cable seemed low. For 999 it is super value for money.\\n\",5\\n\"Hands down, the best Bluetooth earphones at this range!Sound quality is amazing!The bass hits hard!The noise cancellation works like a charm!Overall a worth the price product!Kudos to Boat for this masterpiece!!\\n\",5\\n\"The first impression on the product is good. But when I received the product the package was damaged and the box was crushed a bit. If the same affects the product in near future have to return it to get a new product.\\n\",4\\n\"The mic quality is really bad..the person on other side keep complaining that my voice is breaking.This is very frustrating.After 4 months of normal use (no sports or gym involved) ,right side has stopped working completely.The battery says 80% when you plug into a device,the very next moment it says battery low.\\n\",2\\n\"This product is not working properly. When using voice not hear properly.it\\'s battery discharge with in few minutes of usage. I expected more from this product. But unfortunately now I couldn\\'t use this product. Can you refund my money by return this product ?\\n\",1\\n\"Good morning sir,This is Shiva your boat Bluetooth headset was good but sometimes voice calls not properly respond others voice perfectly not understanding after 2 calls attempting 3rd time it was properly respond.could you resolve this problem and give me your valuable solution.\\n\",2\\n\"Overall good product but if you need bass this is not the one. The rubber top weras off but it\\'s great to use. I bought two of them and use it regularly with out any issues.\\n\",5\\n\"Using This Product 2 months ago product is working fine but the battery of this after 4-5 hours automatically low\\n\",4\\n\"This Product is Dope According to it\\'s price range factor, with pretty Sound Quality but 2months after the initial use The Right Earpiece Stopped to work With Doing any physical damage to the Earplugs. This Problem has Been Faced By many people after some time purchasing this product\\n\",1\\n\"I bought these few days back but not stands for the money which I paid \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x85. Sometimes Bluetooth got disconnected and battary goes down at once.Well I would suggest to buy JBL or Sony instead of these because Sony headphone comes with inbuilt NFCThank you\\n\",3\\n\"Overall nice product for the price. Not the best out there but for someone looking for a Bluetooth headset within budget, it\\'s a really good deal. Battery lasts as well. But would personally recommend keeping another wired earphones for regular use or backup.\\n\",4\\n\"Over all good product. Battery backup is 7 to 8 hrs of usage. Fits well in ears. The only problem i face is that noise cancellation is very strong so if i m puttung on these bluetooth i m not able to listen to anyone.\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s too long, the ear piece comes with no additional attachment it\\'s having only one ear gripper where as many other brands give 2 to 3 attachment\\n\",2\\n\"Very high performance with awesome bass and sound. Battery life is sooo impressive. Thank you BOAT. Thank you AMAZON...!!!\\n\",5\\n\"Sounds quality is good no noise cancellationIt\\'s heavy in ear you can\\'t use it continuouslyMost important its connectivity it proper work when my mobile in front packetWhen I put my mobile in back packet it\\'s not working properly connection break.\\n\",4\\n\"Its average headphones. Battery life is good but product quality is very bad. I buy that product in feb. Jst in month headphones speaker net is damage. Seriously not good qualityTell me if i can exchange my headphones. Its in warranty period\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality is good.... Bass is good..... U can take shower wearing this and can enjoy music also at the same time....if u r looking for waterproof and good quality earphone..... Go for it... Without any hesitation\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is not good.people around hear everything you are listening.while it\\'s not with other inbuilt earphones and also bass is very high and song sound is not pleasing.disappointed\\n\",1\\n\"The battery life is amazing and works for a day with average use.The bass felt a little off but once you get used to it you don\\'t realise any difference.The sound quality is decent for the price.The build and the magnets are also very good.\\n\",4\\n\"Price is aggressive but I\\'m little worried about sound quality. As I used skullcandy ink\\'d wireless, boAt\\'s sound is not upto mark.\\n\",4\\n\"This is really a great product. I am using this product for the past 2 weeks and it is really working well. It allows me to attend Calls, FM (by adding additional FM app), Musics and videos.\\n\",5\\n\"I loved it!! they block all noise. They are flexible. easy to connect. cheap. Altough their earbuds do get loose sometimes but its a minor problem. i got what i was looking for.\\n\",5\\n\"Getting disconnected when I am in traffic but if I am in one place no issues with connectivity otherwise so far so good no problem\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s not at all worth the money and the main reason is its wireless connectivity. Sounds keeps on distorting when you are in motion and your phone is in your pocket or at some distance and that\\'s the main reason for using wireless headphones which this does not fulfils\\n\",1\\n\"Sexy sound, nice durability, nice battery life just causes done distortion when phone is in pant pocket when listening to music\\n\",4\\n\"Bought it at \\xe2\\x82\\xb9999 during sale.Probably the best at its price, boAt never upsets you with their product.After full charge continuous music can be played for 7-7.5 hours.Been 4months and no issues, just a great product.\\n\",5\\n\"My Bluetooth device is not properly working there is some connectivity issues first the device is normally connet to my phone than after some time this was disconnected suddenly without any reasonPlz fix it otherwise gime me anyone some tips for how to fix this problem\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is good only if it worked for a longer period of time. Stopped working exactly after a month!!Can\\'t even return it, so basically stuck with a semi working piece.Not recommended!\\n\",1\\n\"Don\\'t buy this product it\\'s. It stop working in 1 month and it look is very cheap when u put this bluetooth on ur neck. On more thing which I don\\'t like it\\'s sound quality.sound is loud but it\\'s not working as Dolby and it\\'s surrounding sound is very poor.\\n\",2\\n\"Do like the battery backup and the sound quality, for the price you pay you get a lot of earphone here. The design is quite good and you wouldn\\'t notice it when wearing a t shirt. You do notice it while wearing a collared shirt but it\\'s negligible at best.\\n\",4\\n\"This is an amazing product. Delivered by Amazon within 12 hours with \"\"Morning delivery.\"\" A small safety concern that whenever you are using the earphones, the surrounding sound is not audible at all, even if the volume is low. So use it carefully, stay safe and enjoy the product.\\n\",5\\n\"Bought in October 2018, sending for replacement third time. These earphones have more time with boat for replacement than with me . Let\\'s hope they don\\'t replace it time with another faulty headset, Mike stops working,loses charge ,so basically it\\'s a dud headset and a dud brand.\\n\",1\\n\"As mentioned every thing is as it is except noise cancellation. Outside noise irritates to the listener so much. Rest is very good.\\n\",4\\n\"The product is all in one like headphones with mic the rubber is very soft as expected and regarding sound the bass is perfect. And Amazon service is class apart\\n\",5\\n\"Battery discard very fast. 3 hrs on full charge.When you riding bike collar band fly away.Thought it\\'s is wireless headphones but the wire from the collar band to ear buds are too big.\\n\",3\\n\"Excellent product and quality. But only drawback is that the distance covered is only 3 feet...that\\'s quite disappointing !!!\\n\",5\\n\"Good one. Not that great & not at all bad. Sound quality can still be better. Needs more volume.The battery is good. I dont think it lasts as long as its mentioned in the description. But fine. It stays up long enough. Once its at 40%, it falls to W\\n\",3\\n\"Betterty life indicator us not accurate. When it reaches 60% within half and hour you get a bettery low notification. Rest all are perfect at the price.\\n\",4\\n\"Everything is impressive about this product ..... just be aware of the seller.Bcz I have faced issues while checking out with this product.\\n\",5\\n\"It works only when it is charging mode and when after 2 hours we remove the charger it stop working as power is off automatically and even after several attempts it is unable to on. It seems like a faulty headset.\\n\",2\\n\"Excellent product.I use these more than Mivi CollarPlayback time: 6 hrsBass: you won\\'t be disappointed. Thumping bassMids and trebble is above averageNoise isolation is really goodThese offer superior quality for the price you pay\\n\",5\\n\"The battery life is poor. Battery shows as remaining 60% and immediately discharges then.People on the other end of call are not able to hear my voice properly.\\n\",5\\n\"I have received this yesterday as free gift with Huwai y9 mobile.The bass is good and pumped up but it fails to sooth ones ear for low music. the proce of 2990 which supposed to be the MRP is over hyped. it would be of the 1000INR range.\\n\",3\\n\"I got a damaged product on my first delivery then on exchange within 2-3 weeks i am having connectivity issue,  also the voice quality is not as such,  I\\'m not impressed by the product and it\\'s not buying worth it,  and if there would be a return option i would have gone for it\\n\",2\\n\"sound quality is apt with all the right blend of bass n tremble sound is equally clear. battery life is easily 6hr plus in terms continuous and relentless uses of media n can go upto 7 hr or more when listening only to music. product quality is also gud.\\n\",5\\n\"Earphones are awesome. Sound is good and above all they are giving up 5-6 hours of battery backup. Comfortable on the ear. Light weight. Thanks amazon.\\n\",5\\n\"while connected with the phone many times its goes to silent automatically. even sometimes didn\\'t ring while phone need to be ring....also its panic think for ear.... worst product yaaaar\\n\",1\\n\"What I like about this is its lightweight. Comfortable in ear. It\\'s range working perfectly in 20 metres.Now what I think is weak part of the product is sound quality although it is good but not upto the wired one from boat. Also battery life is above average.\\n\",4\\n\"Im writing the review after using 5monthsSound Quality was good and battery backup also fine but when i used after 5months suddenly its stopped workingi bought 1900bucks its not worthyGuys go for another one , We cant spend 1900bucks for just 5months of usage\\n\",1\\n\"Battery life is good but little bit sound quality is low as base and but good for all functions..\\n\",4\\n\"It is available as described in the listing.

Otherwise sound quality and connectivity is Very good. battery life is ok. 6 hrs.\\n\",4\\n\"Overall build quality is good. But, the length of the cables are bit longer and not very comfortable. Bass is good, but treble is less prominent. Battery backup is excellent.\\n\",4\\n\"I just receieved it yesterday.

Also its sound quality is very much appreciable.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is ok but battery life is worst... within one month it has stopped working... no reaponse from boat too... lost my money... plz save urs\\n\",1\\n\"Using it for working out. Sound quality is good, sweat has not affected the performance.\\n\",5\\n\"Firstly I\\'m not very confident about purchasing this product by seeing negative review, but I\\'ve used boat bassheads 225 and boat rockers 400 and they were awesome at their prices l range! These earphones  as of now working flawlessly and I\\'m satisfied with them .\\n\",5\\n\"it\\'s only been a month an already has charging issues. I have been using only the cable that came with it but still no charge. Very disappointed!!!! Not charging at all now!\\n\",2\\n\"I got a already opened package. The product is working fine now, if not I would have replaced it. I don\\'t when it would fail to work also. I am not  paying the full price for already used products Amazon. You should know that. Look at the pictures it\\'s old product\\n\",4\\n\"I have been using this product since 6months and i  faced not even a single issue but one day my one side of earphones stopped working i claimed the warranty and the boat support team was quite supportive. I must say go for it\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb\\n\",4\\n\"Really good quality speakers. The only downside is the 6 hour battery life. Apart from that it is a solid purchase\\n\",5\\n\"2 StarNoise clear it was not to good, I was not happy with this production, I am unable to listen the sound. its too low, can you replace the item, it will be good for me. please reach out to following number. 9972517557 Mahesh Kumar M\\n\",2\\n\"Everything is good apart from longetivity of usage. Maximum I can use 5hrs with full charge.\\n\",5\\n\"Overall... This is an very bad product... Just 1 month... One side of the earphone is not working.... Its surely one useless product guys... Dont buy it.... Go for other earphones other than boat - _-\\n\",1\\n\"On full volume, high bass is a bit distorted but rest in this range, it\\'s an amazing product. Bluetooth range is awesome. I can put this on keep my phone in one corner in the gym and move all around.\\n\",4\\n\"It\\'s a awesome product. Value for money. Total comfort after 2 hrs wearing it. High bass.\\n\",5\\n\"Very good product,if u hav 1.5k go for itGud at battery, bass,durability,built qualityI hav used many Bluetooth earphones but this one is very gud\\n\",5\\n\"Battery died in 2 and a half months. One day it just stopped charging. I\\'m not certain they replace or repair even!\\n\",2\\n\"Sound quality is excellent for the price.battery life is as stated.it will prove best buy  for people on move.phone calls are flawless.sometimes I f mobile is moving ,sound flickers\\n\",4\\n\"Strong bass and overall good soung quality, I would say much better than some Skullcandy and JBL models. Justifies its price aptly.Although it gives a playback time of good 6-7 hrs, I feel it could just have been a little better had it been around >10 hrs.\\n\",4\\n\"After using it for more than a couple of months I would say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decent. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect an exceptional sound quality with this one. However something I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect was a good noise cancellation for an in ear headphone.\\n\",4\\n\"Within 6 months from purchase both the speakers of headphone stopped working. The provided customer service is very bad, they are not even attending the phone call, and taking much time to respond after complain lunched. Don\\'t think product is worth of its money\\n\",1\\n\"The look is great. Sound is average but ergonomics sucks. Needs to be improved.\\n\",3\\n\"The sound quality is not upto the mark. If you watch a movie...The sound start getting distorted after 40-45 mins. Then u need to disconnect and connect again. This is painful. Battery backup is very limited.\\n\",1\\n\"Awesome product. Bass amd mixture of treble is perfect . Sweat proof and the best part is that they plug into ur ear well. Thank You boat\\n\",5\\n\"Pls guys do not purchase it....i have taken in jan 2019 now its not working properly within 4 months....when it is connected to mobile we cannot receive the call n if reveived then other person cannot hear our voice....not at all satisfied with the product.....\\n\",1\\n\"Product packing was received in bad quality.

Was skeptical at first, but I have now owned it for 2 months. Happy about it.My only issue would be the part around the neck. Gets uncomfortable and irritating in humid climates.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought this product in December and in January i.e. almost within a month there is no sound from one earphone.I had contacted boat website to claim warranty two times but they are not registering the product.Not recommended at at all.\\n\",1\\n\"It\\'s very bad experience with the product. It stopped working within 4 months. Both the earphones are not working. This product should be blocked by Amazon. PLEASE DO NOT BUY This product\\n\",2\\n\"Nice sound output at reasonable price. I liked the performance very much. Feel good around the neck\\n\",4\\n\"Remember my sony Ericsson W550i sound. Amazing bass .\\n\",5\\n\"Sound level could have been more.Besides, it does not have option to change the song or pick/cancel a call by its button.\\n\",3\\n\"Product is awesome. No debate on the build quality. Comfortable fit in the ear and also comes with different sized earbuds. Battery life is good too. And main thing sound has great bass and balanced treble and gives crystal clear sound.\\n\",5\\n\"Amazing product, good sound quality and it fits well. The headphone stoped working after 3 months but will have to say Boat has an amazing after sale service (replaced within 5mins and also offer puckup and drop service). I recommend this product.\\n\",5\\n\"I got this earphone of 1k and its awesome. Everything about this earphone is amazing from its colour to durability. If you are looking for a bluetooth earphone with such great features and price you must go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"Great earphones under this price range. Bought these for 1100.great noise cancellation with good base. If you need a bluetooth earphones under this price with Mic, better noise cancellation and high base,go for it.\\n\",4\\n\"Its been almost 4-5 hrs while it\\'s been with me and I think it\\'s very light weight and battery is too good . However base notes are not that good... But not too bad either for the price. Final verdict... Go get it.\\n\",3\\n\"If you are purchasing it for music listening its hot as hell. But if ua purchasing it for calling its dirty as hell, people who u speak with can hear all the noise and talks ij your background and that is something which is xtrmly bad.\\n\",3\\n\"Not working\\n\",1\\n\"The product it excellent but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only been 3 months and the product stopped working as before.

Only cable is little long but overall it\\'s is a nice piece.\\n\",5\\n\"Pathetic it is not getting charged and it is not working at all.\\n\",1\\n\"I\\'m fully satisfied the sound quality and bass..But sometimes it\\'s automatically disconnected with bluetooth paring..Sometimes struck the sound below 10mts frequency range..\\n\",3\\n\"I dislike the that there\\'s way too much bass. So much so that it destroys the balance of the music.I lowkey regret buying these. I like when there\\'s more bass but this is a bit much to enjoy. Sounds muffled.\\n\",3\\n\"I like the product... Long review of this product sound is good. Well fits in ears...You can use it even while working out..\\n\",5\\n\"Do not buy this as its stopped working for me just after 10-15 days.\\n\",1\\n\"Don\\'t use during rain or wet condition ..even in AC also don\\'t use ..it\\'s producing shock at 0.9 Amp almost 1 AMP.it will damage ur ears.take care . i checked with service center they said ..if it\\'s over current flow in unconditional situation..\\n\",1\\n\"It pains a lot after just 15 minutes. Not at all Recommended while riding vehicles.\\n\",2\\n\"This product surely does have good bass and it fits well. The main con would be that the wire extending from the neck band is unnecessarily long and the size cannot be reduced.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is good but the bluetooth gets dropped again and again after just 4 months of purchase...it is irritating.. i do not recommend this product.. i want replacement..\\n\",2\\n\"It is working fine now. But sound quality is not as good as expected.\\n\",4\\n\"Over all the product is nice but battery backup is horrible it hardly last for 3 hours while playing game... I bought this to play pubg but unfortunately i am not able to enjoy it... I wish to return it\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is ok but while driving..lot of disturbance for other in calls..i think noise cancellation not therePerformance very bad..audio breaking while listening songs\\n\",1\\n\"The battery life is poor, it hardly lasts a day. Connectivity is acceptable. Earbuds stings the ears after prolonged use in one sitting. I\\'ll suggest you to buy wired earphones for better sound performance.\\n\",1\\n\"Best in the price range. A Good fit to ears. Amazing bass. Fantastic battery life, a moderate usage resulted to around 9 hours and continuous usage to 5.5 hours. Also, the voice over process for Bluetooth connectivity is surprising.\\n\",4\\n\"Product quality is very poor. You don\\'t know when it will die. Device will show Power level at >30% but suddenly it will drop to zero and die. Even though they gave 3 types of ear caps it won\\'t fit. Overall it\\'s not worth for money.\\n\",3\\n\"It worked for six months and then I am facing power on failure. Now I have registered the complaint for the same. But their service is pathetic. Don\\'t go for this product. If it will stopped working you won\\'t get any service from boat support.\\n\",2\\n\"Everything is okay. Sound quality is good. But it just stopped working after few days. I even got it replaced once but again it just won\\'t start.\\n\",3\\n\"The product is as it says ... Beautiful build quality and unmatched sound. Perfect in this price range\\n\",5\\n\"I use so many Bluetooth headphones but this Bluetooth headset is \"\"Rocked\"\". Excellent sound quality excellent bass.. Must buy this product.. Thanks to Amazon for \\xe2\\x82\\xb9999.\\n\",5\\n\"Worst product ive ever used. Purchased in the month of October and has stopped working now.Took it for a run and stopped midway. Not at all sweatproof.\\n\",1\\n\"I have been using this from 2 months.  Now i am getting the issue with earphones distrubance while talking and quality of sound getting reduce.\\n\",3\\n\"My initial thought about Bluetooth headset will be like, it will be not as good as wired. But after the purchase of boad 255 my thought totally changed. Such a awsum sound, i m sure u r totally fall in love with u r favorite songs.\\n\",5\\n\"I like the sound quality battery duration also good but i personally didn\\'t like the design but overall good out of the design its perfect\\n\",4\\n\"If I put this on for more than 1-2 hours, I sense some pain in my ears. Which is not the case with regular earphones. Other than that, noise cancellation and sound is pretty awesome.\\n\",4\\n\"It worked absolutely fine for 20 days and after that it never connects with any of my device....neither my phone nor my TV...even though it\\'s 100% charged...t\\'s just a piece of crap.\\n\",1\\n\"1:Base is high compared to vocals.2: battery indicator is not accurate but it will last around 5 to 6 hours3: build quality is great.4 : value for money if you get this under 1500rs.\\n\",4\\n\"Good product by Boat, i m using it daily, very light weight, battery backup is average but not poor, if you love to listen Bass boost songs than definitely its for you. Satisfied with this product at the price of 999 /-.\\n\",5\\n\"Both the boat\\'s packaging and amazon\\'s packaging is very poor. I received the product with damaged packaging. The product sounds pretty good but i feel that the durability is very bad especially the charging port\\'s cover\\n\",3\\n\"I didn\\'t receive the product in the product box this empty box from an idiot.\\n\",1\\n\"Great output and sound balance. Noise cancellation works and can be paired easily. It would be a good choice for anyone.\\n\",5\\n\"Hello sir this Shiva i have parched the project of Boat Bluetooth earphones willListening song will  traveling its gets disturbance  or will talking call will traveling it gets disturbance So Please can you help me out in this issue Sir\\n\",2\\n\"bass is not high or bluetooth range is very very poor. If I take phone In my pocket the sound is brake mostly. I am always follow boat product but that time I am very disappoint.\\n\",3\\n\"Sound qualitynis good, but the battery is really horrible.Need some better headphone with good durability.\\n\",1\\n\"Excellent Quality product, Sound is good, Can improve Bass and wire quality.\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is good. Battery does not last for long time. Only one side of the earphone working after 2 months. No way to claim replacement.\\n\",1\\n\"It\\'s a decent Bluetooth earphone. Good lows but the highs, not so good. The wire is flimsy. If it\\'s caught onto something and you try to pull it out, the wire will tear off.. And it happened to me.. Mine is broken already.. Not even a week! So yeah..\\n\",3\\n\"The charge indicator is faulty.....not sure if it\\'s only my product or everyone is facing the same issue\\n\",3\\n\"It was not connecting to my phone, when I connected to other phone I was working good. I want to return the product.\\n\",4\\n\"Bought at Rs. 1700 and good at this price but sound quality is not efficient and both sides sound level is not equal. I will not reccommend for sound lovers.\\n\",3\\n\"The sound quality is not as per my expectation. I am facing Bluetooth connectivity issue if there is a single wall in between me and my mobile which should not be. And this connectivity issue is highly disappointing me.\\n\",3\\n\"This is steal deal @999 and sound quality is good however maximum volume is too high, very comfortable. 5 stars.\\n\",5\\n\"the product is excellent , the only one fault i found is that during the call,when the person cuts the call we wont be able to know whether call is on-going or is been cut,\\n\",4\\n\"Perfect earphones , only minor issue i have is with the charging time otherwise I\\'d say this is the best ,most comfortable earphone anywhere around its price range.\\n\",4\\n\"The sound cancellation in this is amazing. I am a little skeptical of the magnet at the end of the earphone buds damaging the audio quality in the long run. But since I am relatively new buyer, I do not have any issues as of now.\\n\",4\\n\"\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sound quality is good (not the best).\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Battery life is amazing, it\\'s like best in class.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Comfortable but I think the earbuds needs to be more precise and accurate.*After 1day I came across these things*\\n\",4\\n\"For a price tag of 1200, they are fantastic. Especially for workout. Worth every penny! Bass 5/5. Using it on my oneplus 6t which supports Bluetooth equaliser and on the bass boost mode! Its is bomb.\\n\",4\\n\"Very good earphones,with very good battery backup,sound,in ear stability,look,and comfort all points upto the mark..Base is good ,well balanced not very high..Well done boats...\\n\",4\\n\"Nothing to like. Worst product, not worth to buy even for RS. 500. If you really care about review don\\'t buy this product. Stopped working in 1 month. Worst battery backup. Worst quality product nothing good.\\n\",1\\n\"A very good product, the sound quality is also very good, the bass is just perfectThe only problem I\\'m facing is, when we call someone, they hear the sound in background very clear, which is disturbing sometimes.\\n\",4\\n\"My boat rockerz ... Stop giving sound output from right speaker. No service center available. I wast my money . Now what to do. Help me..plz\\n\",1\\n\"when phn is coming there is a no sound ...i am really socked .....Having very bad exprience over here....and there is no replacement policy....totally wastage my money...bad exprience over amazon...\\n\",1\\n\"If ur music lover don\\'t expect much, I have compared with apple airpods and apple airpods are too good. I m returning the product, I don\\'t like quality of the sound,\\n\",1\\n\"Best in class. Product is made with minute things in mind. Fits in your ear. Best bass quality. Clarity in phone calls while bike riding and traffic. Fits in your collar. All black so that it doesnot get dirty. Waterproof. Untangable wire.\\n\",5\\n\"It was working very good for first few days but then:-1. It started producing some annoying sound and the person receiving my call gets irritated.2. Within 1 month it started taking more time to charge with less battery backup.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is excellent, however the mic picks up a lot of the surrounding sound .\\n\",5\\n\"Good Quality...  Even in daily usageBetter battery back up\\n\",4\\n\"Good Product if it is available below 2000 rupees. Great Sound Experience and Connecting Speed. mic is ok. Bass and Sound is good. My Suggestion if it is available below 2000 Go Blindly for buy it.\\n\",4\\n\"Connectivity issue while on call. Bass is good however lacking in voice and others. Battery Backup is pathetic. Spend some more bucks to get a nice wireless earphones.\\n\",1\\n\"I got this boat rockers 2 months back but my left earphone suddenly stopped working and the right earphone\\'s sound also got decreased drastically. Now I just want my earphone to be replaced as soon as possible as it\\'s not performing well.\\n\",1\\n\"Boat rockers 255 wireless earphones was so good and sound quality is very good but the packet of the earphone was damaged and plz tell me  how to register for warranty bcoz I registered there bt I did it get any sms aur mail on my account\\n\",5\\n\"I am buy on rupess 999 in that price is best one . Nice battery life .good sound effect\\n\",4\\n\"I bought this during sale at 1000. Not very much satisfied with the sound quality. Noise cancellation is good and it fits well in ears. But disappointed with ths sound quality. Battery lasts for 4 hours if you use continuously.\\n\",3\\n\"Quality was simply superb. Got this in January and writing the review in July. The battery was pretty fine. Ease of use.\\n\",5\\n\"Stopped working after 6 months when i gave the earphone to service center they took so much time just to give replacement product\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality means bass is excellent as expected.....Better than any other brand in this range of price.\\n\",5\\n\"Waooo...What a battery life....very fast charge...best bettry life...You can rough use this headphones.........i got it at 899....Nd no other headphone can beat it..under 2k...go for it..\\n\",5\\n\"Overall good but not recommend for running and aerobic exercise the earbuds just slipped every time,even in gym also.\\n\",2\\n\"This products was working very good at first but after few days later it\\'s started to disturb. The sound quality get very worse. Now it plays music one side higher and one side lower in volume. Totally bad experience\\n\",1\\n\"Sound quality is excellent.Connected properly with my one plus6\\n\",5\\n\"Beautiful product to carry up and build quality is excellent.

Sound quality is good , but worst build style.\\n\",2\\n\"These are worthless the sound quality is pathetic ,there is no treble lots of bass that to very cheap quality.It\\'s better you buy a wired ear phone or else go for a head phone ,this doesn\\'t fit in any of the two category\\n\",1\\n\"Great sound quality for this price(1200/-5/5).Battery quality should be emproved(Given backup upto 5hour listening4/5). Earphones wire is long should be 1c.m less short.\\n\",5\\n\"Battery is good. Quality of material is also good. The only problem is it has echo, while the headphones are plugged in ear & we try to speak even little louder.\\n\",4\\n\"Not connecting to two devices as mentioned. Range is not more than 5 meters. Box seal was tempered so I replaced the product still got used product.... Seal is tempered.\\n\",3\\n\"Product is not good\\n\",1\\n\"It just so comfortable and sound is sweet!! Base is good. Battery is good enough (not best) I would recommend. Go for it!!\\n\",4\\n\"Overall product is good...sound quality is also good... But I found one problem with this Bluetooth earphones, when I played pubg game with this wireless earphones, at that time I found sound delay... Don\\'t know why this is happening...\\n\",4\\n\"1. sound quality is Decent2. BAD BATTERY LIFE ( only lasts about 4 hous)3. Base is good (Depends person to person )4. noise cancellation is okThe base is there but It will sometimes feels like muddy and not clear\\n\",3\\n\"I would say best bluetooth earphones under such prize range. I bought it for 999 during Amazon Great Indian Sale. Bluetooth connectivity is quite good along with strong noise cancellation. Don\\'t think much and just go for it.\\n\",5\\n\"thanks Amazone... got one time replacement... replacement product is awesome... good sounds and mic also... i m love it... got in 999\\n\",5\\n\"Awesome sound effects and built quality and also best fit for the guys who wear helmets n ride bikes\\n\",5\\n\"All of u buy this one guys.. sound is good and i play pubg mobile game and good quality\\n\",5\\n\"Awesome sound quality and one of the best earphones for the people who go for running and Gym.Its been ore than a week, I am using this product.. so far happy and satisfied by the quality delivered.\\n\",5\\n\"Liked this product a lot using from some days...this is cool\\n\",5\\n\"Bass is Good. Range is also good but the only disadvantage is you can not play PUBG using  this earphone  because the game audio lags for 1-2 sec which  makes  it difficult to play PUBG.Also, Wire is too long\\n\",3\\n\"I received a defective product. One ear piece was broken. The box was torn. Inside the box, the product was all dusty and grubby. Also the invoice was half sliced and I could not even read all my credentials in it.\\n\",3\\n\"The sound was good. It lacked in bass a bit but it\\'s fine. You have to insert it properly in your ears for best effect. One side stopped working as usual but only in 5 months so 3 stars\\n\",3\\n\"The built quality of this headphones is very mediocre and baterry life is disappointing as well.\\n\",3\\n\"Seriously guys you may be reading this review after going through many -ves and +ves .

Decent Bass. The earbuds are not very comfortable. Ears start hurting beyond the second hour. Makes sense to go for a pair wired headphones at the same price.\\n\",3\\n\"Got it at the rock bottom price,. Good deal, thank you Amazon, product is excellent, sound quality is fantastic\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality and it\\'s compatible with iphone 6s\\n\",5\\n\"Sound quality is very good and bass is very high some time it feels not goood\\n\",4\\n\"Went for it looking at the reviews. But it\\'s just another product. Don\\'t expect anything out of the ordinary. Build quality is very pathetic for someone who\\'s a rough user. Would not recommend if you are looking for a quality product.\\n\",1\\n\"Uncomfortable to wear to the extent that one cannot wear them for more than an hour. The earbuds are so heavy that the ear starts to ache. Does not support discord call while gaming...huge disappointment. Mike isn\\'t that great either.\\n\",1\\n\"Sound and bass are really beautiful..  Battery life is good. But there is no noise cancelation system in the device which makes calling very annoying and people keeps complaining present on the other side  about the surrounding sounds\\n\",3\\n\"The sound effect is not like boat bass heads..don\\'t get disappointed expecting the sound effects like boat bass heads.\\n\",1\\n\"liked everything about it. Very useful to pair phones and even y computer.\\n\",5\\n\"Good and very good product in the price range I recommend for people looking for mix use at business and sport no need to have separate earphone\\n\",4\\n\"If ur wearing out of ur T-shirt or Shirt surrounding noise comes too much to other person than ur voice if ur on call.. Nw right ear is not working only one side is working... How to claim the warranty\\n\",3\\n\"Another awesome product by Boat.. Bought it in sale for 1000 bucks n I think thats the best thing i hve bought in sale ever.. Light weight, awesome bass.. Although noise cancellation is not that good during a call..\\n\",5\\n\"I was looking for a good headset without spending much as I have 2 high end Bluetooth headsets. I just loved the product it can be connected with two device. I have connected with my TV and it is working amazing.\\n\",4\\n\"Best battery life... Best sound quality.. After so many earphones even jbl n apple found this one so so satisfied..\\n\",5\\n\"This is a nice one with medium bass annd good sound clarity, I Loved it \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8c,You can take it if your budget is under 2000 ,this is good .\\n\",3\\n\"I didn\\'t like the connectivity range. It is poor and pathetic. Dont even connecting if the phone is kept in Pant pockets. How come it is called as Sportz earphones. Definitely need improvements. Not worth of paying such a huge price.\\n\",2\\n\"Good but please use audify music appafor music because u can control the bass\\n\",5\\n\"The product is value for money, indeed.However, it\\'s Bluetooth connectivity is a not so great - it gets disconnected frequently.The battery life is great. It lasts from 4 days to over a week depending on usage.\\n\",4\\n\"Good headset. Value for money. Bass and music lovers best choise. 2 mobile connection with the heatsdset at the same time is really a great option. But call sound is not that much of good. It may be optimised for ear safe.\\n\",4\\n\"I bought it last week and used it for a couple of days but the voice quality got deteriorated in a day and after I requested for the replacement, a box of used earphones with the broken seal was couriered to me.\\n\",1\\n\"A most durable product that produces excellent quality sound. Quality apart I really appreciate delivery in two days despite my not being a prime member, even during the shopping festival. Well done team Amazon.\\n\",5\\n\"I bought it at rupees 1099.

Awesome product 4.8/5 .Neck bank to be lil small for better hold of single earphone.\\n\",4\\n\"Sound quality is not mind-blowing but is fairly accurate as per price. Battery life is more than what I had expected normal backup at mid volume ranged for about 5-6 hours.

Good sound quality & 8-9 hrs battery life... Just waww look... \\ud83d\\ude09 I brought just 999 rupees...But Amazon's Packageing system is Very bad... Very poor packaging... Flipcart's packaging system is much better than Amazon...\\n\",\n          \"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.
